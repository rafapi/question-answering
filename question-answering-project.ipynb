SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE \\nMITIGATION \\n\\n1.1   Work process \\xe2\\x80\\x93 conceptual approach \\n\\nIn the June 2019 report, the TEG explained the process used to assess and select economic activities for \\ninclusion in the Taxonomy. (Shown in Figure 1). The Taxonomy Regulation has not materially changed \\nthe TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking on methodology for selecting sectors. Further, the TR takes up the TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nrecommended approach to identify enabling activities as a type of activity. \\n\\nFigure 1 Work process for technical screening criteria development \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIdentifying priorities within the potential universe of economic activities.  \\n\\nThe universe of economic activities is described using NACE codes. NACE codes cover 21 broad \\nsectors, with four levels of sub-codes. At the fourth level, 615 classes of economic activity are identified.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  10 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nNot all of these sectors, or economic activities, have high emissions1. Some sectors may have \\ninsubstantial emissions. Others can enable emitting activities to transition to a low carbon economy.   \\n\\nThe TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes. For \\nexample: urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys, support for \\nlower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets, and investments to maintain public natural \\ncapital such as natural forests and wetlands. Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy in \\nfuture.  \\n\\nThe first group of sectors included by the TEG were those with high climate change mitigation need and \\npotential, on the basis of scope 1 emissions data2. In addition, the TEG considered aspects of B \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mining \\nand Quarrying to the extent these supported activities in C \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Manufacturing. However, a full evaluation of \\nthe mining and quarrying sector was not undertaken.  \\n\\nTEG initially used Eurostat emissions inventory data from 2016. More recent emissions data is now \\navailable; however, this does not change the findings of the TEG as the sector profile of Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nemissions was broadly the same in 2016 and 2018.  \\n\\nIn addition, the TEG recognised that failure to address the carbon performance of buildings, which alone \\ncontribute 36% of CO2e emissions in the EU283, would risk causing harm to climate objectives. Buildings \\nare not a single economic activity under the NACE system. The TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s buildings criteria are designed to \\nbe cross-cutting and apply across the economy, with the exception of explicitly excluded sectors \\n(dedicated storage of fossil fuels). For presentation purposes, the TEG has aligned the building criteria \\nwith NACE codes for construction and real estate activities. However, the buildings criteria are not limited \\nto these NACE codes and can be applied across other sectors and economic activities. \\n\\nThe TEG also considered sectors that could enable a substantial contribution in one of the other selected \\nsectors. J - Information and Communication and M - Professional, Scientific Technical activities and due \\nto their potential to be enabling activities. See Table X for a description of enabling activities. \\n\\nThe selected macro-sectors represent a minimum of 93.5% of NACE-based scope 1 emissions in the EU \\n(based on 2018 data), although this figure is likely to be an underestimate as it does not consider \\nbuildings emissions in all sectors.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 Although they may have substantial impacts on other environmental objectives.  \\n\\n2 TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis is based on Scope 1 emissions data as Scope 2 and 3 data by NACE code was not available. However, the \\nTaxonomy recognises energy efficiency improvements consistent with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation.   \\n\\n3 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings. Note that emissions from buildings are considered across \\nNACE codes. Emissions from domestic buildings are typically excluded from NACE codes as domestic occupation is not considered \\nan economic activity. Nonetheless, activities to reduce emissions from the residential sector should be considered in the Taxonomy.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  11 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nTable 1 Types of economic activity contribution \\n\\nConsideration \\n\\nExplanation \\n\\n(1)  High-emitting NACE macro \\n\\nsectors, with substantial \\ncontribution potential \\n\\nQuantitative data on Scope 1 CO2e emissions by NACE code \\nin the EU.

Criteria: including both metrics and thresholds: The method(s) by which the environmental \\nperformance of the economic activity will be measured, including defining the boundary for \\nthis measurement and the qualitative or quantitative conditions which must be met to enable \\nthe performance of the activity in a way that is considered environmentally sustainable. \\n\\n \\n\\n1.2   Defining substantial contribution to climate change mitigation \\n\\nThe Taxonomy Regulation establishes a framework for understanding substantial contributions to climate \\nchange mitigation objectives:   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  14 - \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nArticle 6  \\n\\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation \\n\\n1. An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation where \\nthat activity substantially contributes to the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \\natmosphere at a level which prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by \\navoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing greenhouse gas removals through any of \\nthe following means, including through process or product innovation, consistent with the long term \\ntemperature goal of the Paris Agreement:  \\n\\n(a) generating, transmitting, storing, distributing or using renewable energy in line with Directive \\n(EU) 2018/2001, including through using innovative technology with a potential for significant \\nfuture savings or through necessary reinforcement or extension of the grid;  \\n\\n(b) improving energy efficiency except for power generation activities that are referred to in Article \\n14(2a);  \\n\\n(c) increasing clean or climate-neutral mobility;  \\n\\n(d) switching to the use of sustainably sourced renewable materials;  \\n\\n(e) increasing the use of environmentally safe carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carbon \\ncapture and storage (CCS) technologies that deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gas \\nemissions;  \\n\\n(fa) strengthening land carbon sinks, including through avoided deforestation and forest \\ndegradation, restoration of forests, sustainable management and restoration of croplands, \\ngrasslands and wetlands, afforestation, and regenerative agriculture;  \\n\\n(g) establishing energy infrastructure required for enabling the decarbonisation of energy \\nsystems;  \\n\\n(h) producing clean and efficient fuels from renewable or carbon-neutral sources;  \\n\\n(i) enabling any of the above in accordance with Article 11a. \\n\\n \\n\\n1a. For the purposes of paragraph 1, an economic activity for which there is no technologically and \\neconomically feasible low carbon alternative, shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate \\nchange mitigation as it supports the transition to a climate-neutral economy consistent with a pathway to \\nlimit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels including by phasing out \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, in particular from solid fossil fuels, where that activity:  \\n\\nI. \\n\\nII. \\nIII. \\n\\nhas greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the \\nsector or industry;  \\ndoes not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives; and  \\ndoes not lead to a lock-in in carbon-intensive assets considering the economic lifetime of \\nthose assets. \\n\\nIn addition, the EU has brought forward a proposal for a Climate Law requiring a climate neutral economy \\nby 2050, as well as proposals for interim GHG emissions reductions targets of 50% - 55% by 2030. TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nrecommendations are aligned with these goals.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  15 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n1.3   Eligibility of finance for activities contributing substantially to mitigation \\n\\nThe following table has been updated since the June 2019 report to show how to consider different types \\nof investment and finance as Taxonomy eligible. The update is to more clearly align with the Taxonomy \\nRegulation which clearly identifies enabling activities, reflecting the TEG recommendation. We now refer \\nto the two activity types as either: An activity which has a substantial contribution due to its own \\nperformance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 referring to the operations within the activity, reflecting the activity boundary for the \\ntechnical screening criteria; or an Activity Enabling Mitigation in another economic activity.  \\n\\nThis table also demonstrates how activities that contribute to transition (Transition Activities in the \\nTaxonomy Regulation) are still expected to substantially contribute to climate mitigation objectives and \\nmeet Taxonomy thresholds. This was identified as the third activity type in the June 2019 TEG report. \\n\\n \\n\\n1.4   Further development  \\n\\nThe sectors identified using this methodology are the critical sectors which need to decarbonise to \\nachieve the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2030 and 2050 climate goals. They represent the overwhelming majority of European \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  16 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nemissions7. They are consistent with a broader global consensus and reflect the priority sectors identified \\nfor real-economy reform under the European Green Deal8. \\n\\nOn this basis, the TEG recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance prioritise full evaluation of \\nexisting sectors selected rather than the immediate expansion of the sectors covered. However, the \\nPlatform on Sustainable Finance should continue to monitor sectoral emissions in case of material \\nchanges in the underlying data.   \\n\\nThe TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes. For \\nexample: urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys, support for \\nlower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets, and investments to maintain public natural \\ncapital such as natural forests and wetlands. Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy in \\nfuture.  \\n\\nThe activities identified by the TEG using this methodology reflect the majority \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but not all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of the \\neconomic activities which can avoid significant harm or substantially contribute to climate change \\nmitigation. In some cases, the TEG was not able to fully evaluate the potential contribution of a sub-sector \\nwith the resources available, in the timeframe available. The TEG therefore recommends that the \\nPlatform on Sustainable Finance undertake further evaluation of activities within the existing sectors, with \\na particular focus on: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Manufacturing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 additional high emitting activities  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Transport - including maritime and aviation \\n\\nTEG also recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance continues the work on inclusion of \\nenabling activities within other sectors in the Taxonomy. Recognition of enabling activities is an important \\nway to encourage research, development, innovation and resulting substantial GHG reductions in \\neconomic activities and encourage flows of finance to these activities.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 A minimum of 93%, though the true figure is likely to be higher as buildings do not feature as a separate NACE code and \\nconstitute 36% of EU emissions.   \\n\\n8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  17 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.   SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE \\nADAPTATION  \\n\\nThe methodology for identifying activities that provide a substantial contribution to adaptation has not \\nchanged since the publication of the taxonomy report in June 2019. The substantial contribution criteria \\nfor adaptation have not changed in nature but have been made consistent with the final regulation \\nproposals of December 2019.  \\n\\n2.1   Work process \\xe2\\x80\\x93 conceptual approach  \\n\\nThe proposed approach for an adaptation taxonomy recognises that adaptation is context- and location-\\nspecific and requires the use of a process-based approach to determine if an activity contributes to \\nadaptation and broader system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s climate resilience. The following two-step process aims to demonstrate \\nthat an activity contributes to a substantial reduction of the negative effects of climate change:  \\n\\na.  Assessing the expected negative physical effects of climate change on the underlying economic \\nactivity that is the focus of resilience-building efforts, drawing on robust evidence and leveraging \\nappropriate climate information;  \\n\\nb.  Demonstrating how the economic activity will address the identified negative physical effects of \\n\\nclimate change or will prevent an increase or shifting of these negative physical effects. \\n\\nThe assessment of the contribution of the activity will vary based on its scope (asset, corporate, sector or \\nmarket), as well as spatial and temporal scale. Moreover, the proposed approach recognises that an \\nadaptation activity may target an entity (e.g. a corporation or a city) and/or a market, sector, or region.  \\n\\nActivity-level adaptation aims at strengthening an asset or economic activity to withstand identified \\nphysical climate risks over its lifetime, such as considering sea-level rise in the design of a bridge. \\nSystemic adaptation aims to actively reduce vulnerability and build resilience of a wider system, or \\nsystems, such as a community, ecosystem, or city. \\n\\nThe TEG recognises that climate change will affect all sectors of an economy and all sectors must adapt \\nto its impacts globally. As a result, the adaptation taxonomy is a set of guiding principles and qualitative \\nscreening criteria, which can be applied in any economic activity in any location.  It is, therefore, the view \\nof the TEG that these criteria are globally relevant.   \\n\\nDifferences between climate change adaptation and mitigation \\n\\nThe context-specific nature of adaptation means that it is not possible to produce a stand-alone and \\nexhaustive list of activities that could be viewed as contributing to adaptation under all circumstances. \\nInstead of a list of adaptation activities, a set of guiding principles and screening criteria is used to assess \\nthe potential contribution of an economic activity to adapt to climate change and increase climate \\nresilience. To aid users of the Taxonomy, the TEG has also developed an indicative framework for \\nclassification of climate-related hazards and a climate sensitivity matrix for specific economic activities \\n(see Classification of climate-related hazards and Sectoral climate sensitivity matrices).   \\n\\nThere are fundamental differences between climate change adaptation activities and mitigation activities. \\nFor mitigation activities, a one-tonne reduction of CO2 emissions has the same impact regardless of \\nwhere the mitigation activity takes place. It is therefore possible to define lists of activities that are \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  18 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ndeemed to support climate change mitigation. Adaptation responds to physical climate risks that are \\nmostly location and context specific. For example, there are in principle several engineering and non-\\nengineering options available to a coastal city to respond to the risk resulting from increased sea level. \\nResponses will vary according to where the city is located, its size, the institutional and financial capacity \\nof the city administration to deal with climate risk, the technical and engineering expertise available, the \\npriority of the city, the perception of the citizens, and other factors. The adaptation responses will benefit \\nthe city that adopts them and possibly the systems that depend or interact with the city. \\n\\nType of technical screening criteria \\n\\nThe proposed approach is based on qualitative screening to identify activities that contribute to \\nadaptation. Qualitative screening criteria allow for a structured process-based approach to determine if an \\neconomic activity contributes to adaptation. As measured baselines or accepted metrics for adaptation \\nhave not yet been developed, an established methodology for defining quantitative screening criteria for \\nadaptation and defined adaptation targets at the national, sectoral, or subnational level do not exist. Even \\nwith the availability of methodologies, targets or baselines, quantitative screening criteria could exclude \\nsmall-scale activities that may deliver significant climate-resilience benefits in specific contexts.  \\n\\nThe interaction of climate exposure, resources and socioeconomic characteristics related to a specific \\neconomic activity will determine the nature and scale of adaptation that would be appropriate.  \\n\\nScope of the Adaptation Taxonomy \\n\\nThe Adaptation Taxonomy covers 68 economic activities, which were originally selected for their potential \\nto deliver a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The application of the adaptation \\ntaxonomy beyond these activities is only constrained by the lack of availability of DNSH criteria for the \\nother five environmental objectives covered by the Taxonomy. \\n\\nA number of economic activities that might be important for climate adaptation are not yet included in the \\neconomic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy. The application of the taxonomy will be \\nexpanded to more economic activities as criteria for DNSH to other environmental objectives are \\ndeveloped. \\n\\nIn that respect, the TEG recommends that the economic activities listed in the table below be prioritised \\nfor further work on DNSH criteria to the other environmental objectives because of their high potential for \\na substantial contribution to adaptation.   \\n\\nThe TEG gave close consideration to the inclusion of two of these economic activities into the Taxonomy \\nfor this report: namely, research & development and Telecommunications, computer programming and \\ninformation. The TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis on these issues can be found in the section titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdditional adaptation \\nactivities for further consideration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. However, on due reflection the view was taken that further \\nconsideration of the DNSH criteria for these activities would be needed before this could be done.     \\n\\nThe TEG also recommends that the platform review the proposed DNSH criteria for Non-Life Insurance \\n(65.12) and Engineering Activities and Related Technical Consultancy Dedicated to Adaptation to Climate \\nChange (71.12) as a matter of priority.  These criteria are conservative in that they recognise service \\nprovision only to activities themselves eligible under the Taxonomy.  It may be preferable to simplify the \\ncriteria to increase coverage and enhance usability.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  19 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nSector \\n\\nSpecific NACE codes \\n\\nWater supply, Sewerage, \\nWaste Management and \\nRemediation activities \\n\\nTransport infrastructure \\n\\nAll other water NACE codes not covered to date (36-39) \\n\\nConstruction of water projects (42.21 and 42.91) \\n\\nDesalination (no specific NACE code characterises this activity) \\n \\nRoads (Construction of roads 42.11) \\n\\nTelecoms \\n\\nTelecommunications, computer programming and information \\n(61, 62 and 63) \\n\\nFinance & insurance services  Finance (64) \\n\\nProfessional & scientific \\n\\nManagement consultancy activities (70.2-70.22) \\n\\nScientific Research (72) \\n\\nResearch and development (natural sciences and engineering) \\n(72.1) \\n\\nPublic administration \\n\\n \\nEmergency services (84.25) \\n\\nEducation \\n\\nHealth \\n\\nEcosystem restoration \\n\\n \\n\\nEducation (development of curriculum, provision of teaching) \\n(85) \\n\\nHospital activities (86.1) \\n\\nNoting that Conservation Forestry is now included in the \\nTaxonomy, but other landscape or marine restoration activities \\nare not covered.

An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change adaptation \\n\\nwhere:  \\n\\na. \\n\\nb. \\n\\n \\n\\nthat economic activity includes adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce the \\nrisk of adverse impact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current and \\nexpected future climate on that economic activity itself without increasing the risk of an \\nadverse impact on other people, nature and assets; or where \\nthat economic activity provides adaptation solutions that, in addition to the conditions laid \\ndown in Article 11a, contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of adverse \\nimpact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current and expected future \\nclimate on other people, nature or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverse \\nimpact on other people, nature and assets.    \\n\\n1.a The adaptation solutions referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be assessed and prioritised \\nusing the best available climate projections and shall, as a minimum, prevent or reduce:  \\n\\n(a)  The location-specific and context-specific adverse impact of climate change on the \\n\\neconomic activity; or \\n\\n(b)  The adverse impact that climate change may have on the environment within which the \\n\\neconomic activity takes place   \\n\\n \\n\\nThe adverse impact of climate change considered for the development of the taxonomy include impact \\nresulting from both chronic or slow onset climate-related hazards (such as average temperature increase \\nand sea level rise) and rapid or acute climate related hazards (such as extreme rainfall, storm surges, \\nflooding, and heat waves).  \\n\\nIn this report, material physical climate risk is the risk of (financial and non-financial) losses occurring due \\nto performance failures, performance delays or incomplete performance of an economic activity resulting \\nfrom climate-related hazards.  \\n\\nWith that in mind, the adaptation taxonomy comprises two types of substantial contribution to adaptation \\nobjectives: \\n\\n1.  Adapted activities: an economic activity is adapted to all material physical climate risks identified \\n\\nfor the economic activity to the extent possible and on a best effort basis; and/or \\n\\n2.  Activities enabling adaptation of an economic activity: the activity reduces material physical \\n\\nclimate risk in other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, and is \\nitself also adapted to physical climate risks.  \\n\\nBoth types of activities must also meet the criteria for Do No Significant Harm to other environmental \\nobjectives and comply with minimum social safeguards established for the Taxonomy. Activities adapted \\nto climate change and activities enabling adaptation of other economic activities provide a positive \\nenvironmental impact by meeting a set of technical criteria for substantial contribution to adaptation and a \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  21 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nset of criteria for doing no harm to other environmental objectives, whilst avoiding adverse impacts to \\npeople, asset and nature and preventing a lock-in in activities that undermine long-term environmental \\ngoals.  \\n\\nFigure 3 shows the decision tree to identify substantial contribution to adaptation objectives.10   \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 3 Decision tree for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation \\n\\nThis is consistent with the approach taken when identifying economic activities that substantially \\ncontribute to climate change mitigation in terms of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmitigated activity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactivity enabling mitigation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\nThe first set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via adopting solutions that ensure that the \\neconomic activity can perform well under a changing climate. This contribution to adaptation usually \\noccurs in economic activities that have a primary objective other than climate change adaptation. For \\nexample, a transmission line for the distribution of electricity to an urban area is made more climate \\nresilient to the expected increase in temperature by installing conductors with operating limits at higher \\ntemperature thresholds. Efforts to identify and reduce physical climate risks to an economic activity \\nshould be based on a best effort basis, recognising that it is not possible to reduce physical climate risk to \\nzero. The characteristics of risks to an economic activity are increasingly difficult to predict over long time-\\nhorizons because of the uncertainties associated with future changes in the climate. As a result, \\nadaptation of an economic activity requires a proportionate, flexible and an iterative risk management \\napproach that can be adjusted over time. \\n\\nThe second set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via enabling the adaptation of other \\neconomic activities. For example, the construction of a flood protection system is performed to reduce the \\nrisk of flood for a facility or a city and the economic activities that take place in it. Similarly, the research, \\n\\n \\n\\n10 In this report, adaptation solutions describe the set of all possible measures, actions, adjustments, changes, applications, \\nproducts, services, etc. that contribute to adapt to a changing climate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  22 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ndevelopment and commercialisation of drought-resistant crop varieties will help ensure crop production \\nyields despite increased risk of droughts.  \\n\\nSolutions that support adapted activities and economic activities enabling adaptation are clearly linked \\nand may overlap. However, the distinction between these two types of adaptation activities can guide \\ndifferent user types. Adapting an economic activity captures the solutions required by actors to increase \\ntheir own resilience, whilst enabling activities capture the research, development, marketing, and \\ninstallation of solutions that will help other entities to adapt.  For example, a water utility vulnerable to \\nincreased risk of floods may adopt early warning systems to reduce this risk, and this would count as part \\nof the programme of solutions that entity is taking to ensure their activity is adapted to climate change, i.e. \\npart of their response to adapting that economic activity. However, a small or medium-sized enterprise \\n(SME) developing the technology for flood early warning systems to support adaptation of other sectors, \\nincluding by the water utility company.  This activity of the technology developer is therefore counted as \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98enabling adaptation\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  This example is illustrated in Figure 8 below. \\n\\nTaxonomy users \\n\\nEconomic activities \\n\\nTypes of adaptation \\n\\nProducts & services  \\n\\nSME develops early warning \\n\\nEconomic activity enabling \\n\\nsystems for flood risk \\n\\nadaptation \\n\\nCorporate \\n\\nWater utility deploys early \\n\\nAdapted economic activity \\n\\nwarning system to reduce risk \\n\\nof flood \\n\\nExamples of financial flows11  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nInvestors hold shares in SME developing products for adaptation \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Banks loan money to utility to finance the deployment of early warning system \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nInvestors holds shares in utility with more climate resilient operations \\n\\nFigure 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Example of different types of adaptation activities and Taxonomy users \\n\\nSome of the economic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy might often fall under the category \\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99, others might be \\xe2\\x80\\x98activities enabling adaptation\\xe2\\x80\\x99. There will be activities that can be \\neither type depending on their purpose and the context within which the activity takes place. What is key \\nis the primary objective of the actor engaged in that activity. For this reason, the economic activities are \\nnot a priori categorised into \\xe2\\x80\\x98Adapted activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and/or \\xe2\\x80\\x98Activity enabling adaptation\\xe2\\x80\\x99, this is left to the \\ndiscretion of the user.  \\n\\n11 See section 2.4 for eligibilities of finance to be counted as climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  23 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nFor example, Conservation Forestry could be deemed to be an activity enabling adaptation if the primary \\nobjective of the conservation activity is to support the adaptation of other economic activities or actors \\ne.g. to prevent soil erosion damaging agricultural production or threatening local settlements or water \\nsupplies.  Conversely, Conservation Forestry where the primary purpose is to promote biodiversity may \\nbe treated as an \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if they are at the same time ensuring that those forests are resilient to \\nclimate change risks.  This is a difficult line to drawn given the inter-relationships and co-benefits between \\nthese objectives.  In such cases, users are asked to identify and justify whether their activity should be \\nviewed as an \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or an \\xe2\\x80\\x98activity enabling adaptation of other economic activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and meet \\nthe appropriate criteria accordingly. \\n\\nAlternatively, construction of a new building (NACE code F41 or F43) could be deemed to be an \\xe2\\x80\\x98activity \\nenabling adaptation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if the building is specifically purposed for adaptation and resilience, e.g. shelters or \\nsafe buildings for evacuation from flooding/typhoons.  (This is not unusual in countries like Bangladesh \\nand the Philippines, though not common practice in Europe). But where not specifically purposed, \\nconstruction of a new building would only make a substantial contribution to adaptation via becoming an \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99. \\n\\nGuiding principles for substantial contributions to climate change adaptation  \\n\\nThe TEG proposes the following guiding principles to identify an economic activity that substantially \\ncontributes to climate change adaptation:  \\n\\nPrinciple 1: The economic activity reduces all material physical climate risks to the extent \\npossible and on a best effort basis.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nIn the case of an adapted economic activity, the activity integrates measures aimed at reducing \\nall material physical climate risks to that activity as identified through an assessment of risks \\nposed by both current weather variability and expected future climate change. The assessment \\nshould take into account chronic and acute climate-related hazards and associated physical \\nclimate risks across a range of scenarios, and account for uncertainty. It should consider \\ngeographic and temporal scales that are appropriate for the economic activity.  \\n\\nIn the case of \\xe2\\x80\\x98an economic activity enabling adaptation, the activity reduces material risks to \\nother economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, for example through a \\ndedicated asset, technology, service or product, and itself integrates measures aimed at reducing \\nmaterial risks where applicable (e.g. in the case of a dedicated asset).  \\n\\nPrinciple 2: The economic activity does not adversely affect adaptation efforts by others.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Economic activities and the measures taken to address the material climate risks facing those \\n\\nactivities should be consistent with adaptation needs in the applicable sector or region, \\nconsidering opportunities to build resilience outside of the premises of a single activity. Those \\nmeasures should also not increase the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature and \\nassets in terms of hindering adaptation efforts by others for example by shifting impacts faced by \\nothers  \\n\\nPrinciple 3: The economic activity has adaptation-related outcomes that can be defined and \\nmeasured using adequate indicators.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  24 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  When possible, the outcomes of adaptation activities should be monitored and measured against \\n\\ndefined indicators for adaptation results. If possible, updated assessments of physical climate \\nrisks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency (e.g. every five or ten years) depending \\non the risks, the context and the availability of new information, technologies or approaches or \\npolicies and regulations. \\n\\n \\n\\n2.3   Screening criteria for activities making a substantial contribution to \\nadaptation  \\n\\nWhile the principles describe the foundations and qualities underpinning economic activities that \\ncontribute to climate change adaptation, the screening criteria are specific characteristics that can be \\nused to determine whether an economic activity provides a substantial contribution to adaptation. These \\nscreening criteria vary between \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activities and activities that enable adaptation. These criteria \\nhave been updated since the June 2019 report. \\n\\n Screening criteria for \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an economic activity \\n\\nTable 3 Screening criteria for substantial contribution: adapted activities \\n\\nCriterion \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nA1: Reducing material \\nphysical climate risks \\n\\nThe economic activity must reduce all material physical climate risks \\nto that activity to the extent possible and on a best effort basis.  \\n\\nA1.1  The economic activity integrates physical and non-physical measures \\naimed at reducing - to the extent possible and on a best effort basis - \\nall material physical climate risks to that activity, which have been \\nidentified through a risk assessment.  \\n\\nA1.2 \\n\\n The above-mentioned assessment has the following characteristics: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nconsiders both current weather variability and future climate \\nchange, including uncertainty; \\n\\nis based on robust analysis of available climate data and \\nprojections across a range of future scenarios; \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nis consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity. \\n\\nA2:  Supporting system \\nadaptation \\n\\nThe economic activity and its adaptation measures do not adversely \\naffect the adaptation efforts of other people, nature and assets. \\n\\nA2.1  The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase \\nthe risks of an adverse climate impact on other people, nature and \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  25 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nassets, or hamper adaptation elsewhere.

Recognising that risk evolves over time, updated \\nassessments of physical climate risks should be undertaken at the \\nappropriate frequency where possible. \\n\\nScreening criteria for an activity enabling adaptation \\n\\nThe table below describes the screening criteria for economic activities enabling adaptation. \\n\\nTable 4 Screening criteria for substantial contribution: economic activities enabling adaptation \\n\\nCriterion \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nB1. Supporting \\nadaptation of other \\neconomic activities \\n\\nThe economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other \\neconomic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation. \\nActivities enabling adaptation include, but are not limited to, activities \\nthat: \\n\\na)  Promote a technology, product, practice, governance \\n\\nprocess or innovative uses of existing technologies, products \\nor practices (including those related to natural infrastructure); \\nor, \\n\\nb)  Remove information, financial, technological and capacity \\n\\nbarriers to adaptation by others. \\n\\nB1.1  The economic activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical \\n\\nclimate risks beyond the boundaries of the activity itself. The activity \\nwill need to demonstrate how it supports adaptation of others \\nthrough: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  an assessment of the risks resulting from both current \\n\\nweather variability and future climate change, including \\nuncertainty, that the economic activity will contribute to \\naddress based on robust climate data; \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  26 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  an assessment of the effectiveness of the contribution of the \\neconomic activity to reducing those risks, taking into account \\nthe scale of exposure and the vulnerability to them \\n\\n \\n\\nB1.2 \\n\\nIn the case of infrastructure linked to an activity enabling adaptation, \\nthat infrastructure must also meet the screening criteria A1, A2 and \\nA3.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe TEG recommends that the Platform, as a matter of priority, develops technical guidance on climate \\nrisk assessment, use of climate data and information, making decisions under uncertainties and \\nevaluation of different adaptation options to aid the implementation of the taxonomy. \\n\\n \\n\\n2.4   Eligibility of finance for activities contributing substantially to adaptation \\n\\nIn the case of an economic activity enabling adaptation, the revenue and/or expenditure associated with \\nthe economic activity that meets the relevant screening criteria is considered as eligible. \\n\\nIn the case of an adapted economic activity, at this time, only the costs of adaptation can be counted, not \\nthe revenues and/ or expenditure associated with the whole activity.  This is because adaptation of an \\neconomic activity is delivered in activities that have primary objectives other than adaptation (for example \\nadaptation of an electricity transmission line to increased risk of flood). When those activities are adapted \\nto cope with physical climate risk, they contribute to the climate resilience of the entire, highly integrated \\nand interconnected economic system and as a result, deliver a global benefit through aggregated \\nadaptation in all sectors of an economy. However, methodologies, tools and metrics to measure these \\nclimate resilience benefits remain under development. These technical limitations mean that counting \\nonly the costs of adaptation of the economic activity is the most viable, conservative option today. \\n\\nIn some circumstances, investments required to adapt an economy activity may be large and \\nimplemented in phases as part of an adaptation plan, which has been developed in response to a climate \\nrisk assessment. In these circumstances, investments in measures included in a full programme of \\nactions that collectively reduce the material physical climate risks to the economic activity can be counted \\nin phases, even if the whole adaptation plan has not been executed.  It is expected that the full \\nprogramme of measures would be executed over a period of time no longer than 5 years.  \\n\\nIt is proposed that, as a matter of priority, the Platform undertake further work to develop approaches for \\nmeasuring the climate resilience benefits of adapted economic activities. This is a key step in moving \\ntowards recognising all revenue and/or expenditure associated with an economic activity that is adapted \\nto cope with physical climate risk and yields high climate resilience benefits. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  27 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.5   Classification of climate-related hazards \\n\\nThe TEG has developed a classification of climate-related hazards. When developing the Taxonomy, the \\nclimate-related hazards considered are limited to the potential occurrence of a weather and climate-\\nrelated natural physical event or trend12. \\n\\nThe climate-related hazard classification comprises four major hazard groups, with hazards related to \\nwater, temperature, wind, and mass-movements. All groups include acute (extreme) and chronic (slow-\\nonset) hazards, as adaptation must account for both rapid as well as gradual changes in the weather and \\nclimate to take the appropriate adaptation measures and avoid maladaptation.13 \\n\\nThis analysis focusses on the most important or significant hazards and is designed to guide the user to \\nconsider the most salient physical risks when mapping the sensitivities of a given sector.  \\n\\nAll secondary hazards14 resulting from climate-related hazards (including but not limited to chemical, \\nbiological, ecological and epidemiological hazards) are excluded. It is however advisable to assess the \\nrisk of such secondary hazards and consider measures to address them for each economic activity.  \\n\\n \\n\\nTemperature-\\nrelated \\n\\n \\n\\ni\\n\\nc\\nn\\no\\nr\\nh\\nC\\n\\nChanging \\ntemperature (air, \\nfreshwater, marine \\nwater) \\n\\nHeat stress  \\n\\nTemperature \\nvariability \\n\\nPermafrost thawing \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 5 - Classification of climate-related hazards \\n\\nWind-related \\n\\nWater-related \\n\\nSolid mass-related \\n\\nChanging \\nprecipitation patterns \\nand types (rain, hail, \\nsnow/ice) \\n\\nPrecipitation and/or \\nhydrological \\nvariability \\n\\nCoastal erosion \\n\\nSoil degradation \\n\\nOcean acidification \\n\\nSoil erosion \\n\\nSaline intrusion \\n\\nSolifluction \\n\\nSea level rise  \\n\\nWater stress \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nChanging wind \\npatterns \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 IPCC, 2014, Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

Geophysical and technological hazards are outside the domain of adaptation to climate change. \\n\\n14 As an example, new biological pests or increased prevalence of existing pests can result from changing temperatures. Forests \\nand agriculture are typically sensitive to warmer (minimum) temperatures and, in this example, their effects on pests. In this case, \\nthe changing prevalence of pests is a secondary hazard against which adaptation measures may be needed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  28 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nHeat wave \\n\\nCold wave/frost \\n\\nCyclone, hurricane, \\ntyphoon  \\n\\nStorm (including \\nblizzards, dust and \\nsandstorms) \\n\\nDrought \\n\\nAvalanche \\n\\nHeavy precipitation \\n(rain, hail, snow/ice) \\n\\nLandslide \\n\\nWildfire \\n\\nTornado \\n\\nFlood (coastal, \\nfluvial, pluvial, ground \\nwater)  \\n\\nSubsidence \\n\\n \\n\\ne\\nt\\nu\\nc\\nA\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGlacial lake outburst \\n\\n \\n\\n3.   DO NO SIGNIFICANT HARM (DNSH)  \\n\\n3.1   DNSH to environmental objectives 3-6 \\n\\nUnder the proposed Taxonomy regulation, economic activities making a substantial contribution to \\nclimate change mitigation or adaptation must be assessed to ensure they do not cause significant harm to \\nall remaining environmental objectives. An activity contributing to climate change mitigation must avoid \\nsignificant harm to climate change adaptation and the other four environmental objectives:  \\n\\n3.  Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources  \\n4.  Transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling \\n5.  Pollution prevention and control \\n6.  Protection of healthy ecosystems \\n\\nThis assessment ensures that progress against some objectives are not made at the expense of others \\nand recognises the reinforcing relationships between different environmental objectives. In its future \\ndevelopment, the Taxonomy will also include activities that make a substantial contribution to the above \\nobjectives..  \\n\\n \\n\\n3.2   DNSH to climate change adaptation \\n\\nPer Article 12 of the Taxonomy regulation, an economic activity shall be considered as significantly \\nharming climate change adaptation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere that activity leads to an increased adverse impact of the \\ncurrent and expected climate, on itself or for other people, nature and assets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\nIn terms of what constitutes or leads to an increased negative effect of climate by an economic activity for \\nand beyond the environment within which that economy activity takes place, it is proposed that the DNSH \\nto adaptation criteria should ensure that both: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The services that economic activities/ vulnerable populations/ vulnerable ecosystems rely on need to \\n\\nbe resilient to climate change. If they are not and those services are significantly curtailed due to \\nclimate change impacts, the resilience and ability to adapt of those activities/ populations/ \\necosystems is weakened.  This can be achieved by ensuring that all material risks to the economic \\nactivity itself have been reduced to the extent possible and on a best effort basis.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  29 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Those services are not being delivered in a way that adversely affects the adaptation efforts of others.  \\n\\nDiscussion was had on whether compliance with these requirements should be determined on a case-by-\\ncase basis through an activity and context specific assessment, or whether an a-priori activity only level \\nassessment is needed.  As discussed above, adaptation needs and impacts of activities on adaptation \\nand resilience are context specific and therefore a context specific assessment is needed.   \\n\\nFor these reasons, the two criteria described in Table 6 are proposed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDNSH to adaptation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for all \\neconomic activities.  In addition to these criteria, the TEG has considered where there are any examples \\nof tools, methodology or other guidance that might be of use in applying these two criteria in the context \\nof a specific economic activity.  Where such examples have been identified, they have been noted in the \\nDNSH to Adaptation section of the appropriate economic activity. \\n\\nIt is noted that for new economic activities, the following criteria must be met at the point of design and \\nconstruction.  For existing activities and associated assets, where addressing physical climate risks \\nrequires a retrofit of some kind, all material physical climate risks must be assessed and adaptation \\nmeasures required to address them must be identified and programmed with a clear and time limited \\nexecution plan no longer than 5 years.  \\n\\nTable 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Do no significant harm to adaptation: \\xe2\\x80\\x98adapted economic activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\nCriterion \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nThe economic activity must reduce all material physical climate risks to the \\nactivity to the extent possible and on a best effort basis.  \\n\\nCriterion A1: \\nReducing \\nmaterial \\nphysical \\nclimate risks \\n\\nA1.1  The activity integrates physical and non-physical measures aimed at reducing - \\n\\nto the extent possible and on a best effort basis - all material risks that have \\nbeen identified through a climate risk assessment. For existing activities, the \\nimplementation of those physical and non-physical measures may be phased \\nand executed over a period of time of up to 5 years. For new activities, \\nimplementation of these measures must be met at the time of design and \\nconstruction.  \\n\\nA1.2 \\n\\n The above-mentioned climate risk assessment has the following \\ncharacteristics: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nconsiders both current weather variability and future climate change, \\nincluding uncertainty; \\n\\nis based on robust analysis of available climate data and projections \\nacross a range of future scenarios; \\n\\nis consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  30 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCriterion A2:  \\nSupporting \\nsystem \\nadaptation \\n\\nThe economic activity and its adaptation measures do not adversely affect the \\nadaptation efforts of other people, nature and assets. \\n\\nA2.1 \\n\\n The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase the risks of \\nan adverse climate impact on other people, nature and assets or hamper \\nadaptation elsewhere. Consideration should be given to the viability of \\'green\\' \\nor \\'nature-based-solutions\\' over \\'grey\\' measures to address adaptation. \\n\\nA2.2  The activity is consistent with sectoral, regional, and/or national adaptation \\n\\nefforts.  \\n\\n \\n\\n3.3   DNSH to environmental objectives 3-6 \\n\\nIn accordance with Article 14 of the Taxonomy proposal, the DNSH criteria aim to specify the minimum \\nrequirements to be met to avoid significant harm to environmental objectives relevant to each economic \\nactivity. Article 12 provides further details on what constitutes significant harm for each environmental \\nobjective: \\n\\nTable 7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Do no significant harm criteria: environmental objectives 3-6 \\n\\nObjective \\n\\nConditions for causing \\xe2\\x80\\x98significant harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\n\\n(3)  Sustainable use and \\n\\nprotection of water and \\nmarine resources  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6where that activity is detrimental to the good status, or where \\nrelevant the good ecological potential, of water bodies, including \\nsurface waters and groundwaters, or to the good environmental \\nstatus of marine waters; \\n\\n(4)  Circular economy \\n\\nincluding waste \\nprevention and recycling \\n\\n...where that activity leads to significant inefficiencies in the use \\nof materials and the direct or indirect use of natural resources \\nsuch as non-renewable energy sources, raw materials, water \\nand land in one or more stages of the life-cycle of products, \\nincluding in terms of durability, reparability, upgradability, \\nreusability or recyclability of products; or where that activity \\nleads to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or \\ndisposal of waste, with the exception of incineration of non-\\nrecyclable hazardous waste, or where the long term disposal of \\nwaste may cause significant and long-term harm to the \\nenvironment; \\n\\n(5)  Pollution prevention and \\n\\ncontrol \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6where that activity leads to a significant increase in the \\nemissions of pollutants into air, water or land, as compared to \\nthe situation before the activity started; \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  31 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(6)  Protection of healthy \\n\\necosystems \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6where that activity is detrimental to a significant extent to the \\ngood condition and resilience of ecosystems or where that \\nactivity is detrimental to the conservation status of habitats and \\nspecies, including those of Community interest. \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, the regulation specifies that for all objectives: the environmental impacts of the activity itself, \\nas well as of the products and services provided by that activity throughout their life cycle shall be taken \\ninto account, notably by considering their production, use and end-of life. \\n\\nThe technical screening criteria proposed by the TEG contain quantitative thresholds where possible. \\nWhere this is not possible, the criteria are qualitative, describing an action or set of actions to be \\ndemonstrated which avoid significant harm. \\n\\nThe baseline scenario for the economic activities is compliance with relevant EU environmental \\nlegislation. To this end, the criteria take into account existing EU legislation. The call for additional \\nexpertise to inform the TEG and the process described below enabled the establishment of criteria based \\non available scientific evidence. Where evidence was not conclusive, the precautionary principle \\nenshrined in article 191 TFEU was taken into account, as required in Article 14 of the draft regulation. \\n\\nTo the extent possible, the screening criteria, whether qualitative or quantitative, were selected to \\nfacilitate the verification of compliance. In many instances, the proposed criteria are expressed in terms of \\ncompliance with relevant EU legislation and/or associated reference information, such as the best \\navailable techniques (BAT) reference documents (also known as \\xe2\\x80\\x98BREFs\\xe2\\x80\\x99).15 \\n\\nThe technical screening criteria (TSC) process \\n\\nFigure 9 presents an overview of the process for development of DNSH technical screening criteria \\nagainst activities expected to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. For each \\nactivity, the scope was reviewed to identify life cycle aspects and activity boundaries. Where linkages with \\nother activities occurred (i.e. where life cycle aspects overlapped with other activities), this has been \\nreferenced in the analysis.  \\n\\n1. \\n\\nInitial screen for activities which could cause significant harm to each environmental \\nobjective. This analysis was carried out within the scope defined for the economic activity as \\nidentified for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives. In this analysis, TEG \\nmembers and additional experts have considered all material life cycle stages of the performance \\nof the economic activity within the scope of the mitigation screening criteria. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 The BREF list of reference documents have been drawn (or are planned to be drawn) as part of the exchange of information \\ncarried out in the framework of Article 13(1) of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED, 2010/75/EU) and other policy/legislative \\ninstruments. BREF are available at http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  32 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.  Life cycle thinking. A life cycle approach was adopted to establish the technical screening \\n\\ncriteria for DNSH in accordance with Article 14.1(f) of the Taxonomy proposal.16 This approach \\nprovided a robust way to avoid errors such as considering sustainable any economic activity that \\nmay have negative effects during its upstream or downstream stages. Questions asked and \\nresolved included: \\n\\na.  what would generate significant harm during the life cycle of the activity? \\n\\nAND  \\n\\nb.  can this risk be addressed by complying with EU legislation and best practices, \\n\\ninternational standards or guidelines? \\n\\n \\n\\n3.  Sectoral activities with high mitigation potential not included in the Taxonomy. Where \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98significant harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to one or more environmental objectives by the activity cannot be avoided \\nthrough TEG requirements, the activity was not included in the Taxonomy. Material issues \\nwhereby an activity is considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Taxonomy may include but are \\nnot limited to: lack of empirical data for reasonable evaluation of DNSH (in line with the \\nprecautionary approach), lock-in and intergenerational risks.  \\n \\n\\n4.  Evaluate and document key findings from relevant research and technical publications. \\n\\nAuthoritative publications were reviewed to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential \\nenvironmental exposures, and to identify material exposures for further consideration which may \\nnot be captured in existing EU legislation, BEMP, BAT and BREF.  \\n \\n\\n5.  EU environmental acquis. Protection of the environmental objectives relating to water \\n\\nresources, circular economy, pollution prevention and the control and protection of ecosystems is \\nadvanced at the EU level with associated methodologies and thresholds, as contained in the \\nexisting body of EU environmental law (i.e. the environmental acquis).17 Existing EU legal \\nrequirements apply across the Taxonomy. Therefore, for an activity to be included, it must at \\nminimum comply with EU legal requirements, as well as national legal requirements and \\nrequirements relating to the environmental permits needed for its operation. EU legal \\nrequirements were considered as minimum requirements and were in general not repeated in the \\nDNSH evaluation. When an environmental impact was considered significant, the relevant EU \\nlegal requirements (including BREF) and/or national requirements were included in the DNSH \\ncriteria, unless more specific requirements were deemed necessary to avoid significant harm. \\n \\n\\n6.  Global Context. The Taxonomy can potentially be used for economic activities outside of the EU. \\nThe technical screening criteria for DNSH provide necessary performance levels or thresholds for \\nEU issued financial products. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n16 Article 14.1(f) states: The technical screening criteria adopted in accordance with Articles 6(2), 7(2), 8(2), 9(2), 10(2) and 11(2) \\nshall take into account the environmental impacts of the economic activity itself, as well as of the products and services provided by \\nthat economic activity, notably by considering their production, use and end-of-life. \\n\\n17 Access to EU environmental legislative and policy summaries is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/summaries.html. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  33 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n7.  Splitting DNSH criteria. The scope of activities taken into consideration for DNSH mirrors the \\n\\nmitigation scope of activities. However, for a small number of activities two or three differing sets \\nof DNSH criteria were deemed necessary. As an example, within the manufacturing macro-\\nsector, NACE code 20.13: Manufacture of other inorganic basic chemicals, there is one set of \\nmitigation criteria and three sets of DNSH criteria divided into soda ash, carbon black and \\nchlorine. \\n\\n8.  Selection of technical screening criteria. The \\xe2\\x80\\x98do no significant harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99 evaluation focussed only \\n\\non the most significant aspects of concern and developed threshold screening criteria where: \\n\\na.  avoiding significant harm requires criteria that differ from EU legislation \\nb.  alignment with international standards, laws, conventions and the global SDGs was \\n\\nc. \\n\\nconsidered necessary \\nissues were identified as most significant in a global context, even if resolved at the \\nEuropean level \\n\\nd.  special care was needed to address local geographical/physical, climatological and/or \\n\\nhydrological conditions \\n\\ne.  other sectoral specific aspects concerning one or more of the DNSH objectives, as \\n\\ndetailed in the rationale, were found \\n\\n \\n\\n-  34 - \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Do no significant harm decision tree \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  35 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nEligible NACE Codes - \\n\\nPoints of Note \\n\\n3.4   Use of NACE \\n\\nThis report uses NACE for industry classification and the TEG has developed screening criteria for priority \\nsectors within NACE. Other activities may be also eligible, so long as the company or investor can \\ndemonstrate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria and that no significant harm has been \\ndone to any other environmental objective. \\n\\nExamples of these include: \\n\\nManufacturing \\n\\nFor some corporates who manufacture as well as sell the end products, they may attribute revenue to the \\nend product rather than to the manufacturing process. Technical screening criteria in this report lays out \\nexpectations of the manufacturing process. When aligning testing criteria to manufacturing, it may be \\nnecessary to review revenue classified to the sale of the end product by the same organisation, even \\nthough the eligible activity would be assessed within the manufacturing processes. This is not a supply \\nchain assessment, the corporate needs to own the manufacturing process to qualify. \\n\\nFor example, technical screening criteria are provided under NACE code 23.51 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Manufacture of Cement. \\nHowever revenue for these manufacturing processes may be attributed under: \\n\\nName \\n\\nNACE  Name \\n\\nConcrete Products \\n\\n23.61  Manufacture of concrete products for construction purposes \\n\\nConcrete Block & Brick \\n\\n23.61  Manufacture of concrete products for construction purposes \\n\\nConcrete Pipe \\n\\n23.61  Manufacture of concrete products for construction purposes \\n\\nOther Concrete Products \\n\\n23.61  Manufacture of concrete products for construction purposes \\n\\n \\n\\nSimilarly for non-ferrous metals, the production process should meet the testing criteria but the revenue \\nmay be attributed under the final product. \\n\\nName \\n\\nNACE \\n\\n Description \\n\\nIron & Steel Forging \\n\\n25.50 \\n\\n  Hot, warm and cold forge both iron and steel. \\n\\nMetal Containers & Packaging  25.92 \\n\\n  Manufacture metal containers used in packaging \\napplications. Includes metal cans and aluminium foil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  36 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nWhen considering an activity that does not align with the provided NACE codes, it may be possible that \\nthe activities of that corporate can still make a substantial contribution to one or more of the \\nenvironmental objectives. This activity can be considered eligible, so long as the testing criteria that exist \\nwithin the report are satisfied.  \\n\\nConstruction \\n\\nActivities of main and secondary building contractors can be found within NACE 43, with additional \\nsub-sectors under NACE 42. The activities of these companies could be considered eligible (as enabling \\nactivities) if they contribute to construction activities that comply with the taxonomy criteria set under \\xe2\\x80\\x98New \\nConstructions and Renovations\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Eligibility would need to be assessed on a project-by-project basis, as a \\ncontractor would have different projects within their portfolio of work, some complying with the taxonomy \\nand others not.  \\n\\nActivities of manufacturers of building products and machinery (sub-sectors within NACE 16, 23 \\nand 28) could be considered eligible (as enabling activities) if they produce low carbon technologies for \\nbuildings (for example, efficient windows, insulation etc.) and comply with the criteria set out within the \\nmanufacturing section of this report. \\n\\nReal estate brokers and agencies (NACE 68.31) activities could be considered eligible (as Enabling \\nActivities) if they support the acquisition of properties that comply with the criteria set for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalculated \\nperformance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in acquisition & ownership, but this would have to be assessed and disclosed on an \\nacquisition-by-acquisition basis.  \\n\\nProperty management (NACE 68.32) - Activities of these companies could be considered eligible (as \\nEnabling Activities) if they satisfy the criteria for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeasured performance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d set in Acquisition & Ownership; \\ncompliance would have to be assessed on a property-by-property basis. \\n\\n \\n\\n3.5   Assessing the Taxonomy criteria for Green Debt and Loans \\n\\nGreen debt or lending activities may be allocated a NACE or equivalent industry classification code. \\nWhere financial instruments are allocated a NACE listed in this report, the substantial contribution and \\nsignificant harm tests can be applied as listed. However, there may be some examples where the activity \\nmay be suitable to test, even if the industry or sector of the overall business may not be listed within this \\nreport.

FORESTRY  \\n\\nWhy forestry is included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nThe Taxonomy defines forest in accordance with the definitions of the UN Food and Agriculture \\nOrganization.18 In this context, a forest is considered as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLand spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees \\nhigher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds \\nin situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (UNFAO, \\n2019)19. In the context of the Taxonomy, plantations forests are specifically excluded. Plantations are \\ndefined by the FAO as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanted Forest that is intensively managed and meet ALL the following criteria at \\nplanting and stand maturity: one or two species, even age class, and regular spacing. 1. Specifically \\nincludes: short rotation plantation for wood, fibre and energy; 2 Specifically excludes: forest planted for \\nprotection or ecosystem restoration; 3. Specifically excludes: Forest established through planting or \\nseeding which at stand maturity resembles or will resemble naturally regenerating forest. Recognising \\nthat countries or country groups may set specific definitions of forest to represent specific regional \\nconditions, the Taxonomy allows for the use of forest definitions developed under regional processes, \\nsuch as Forest Europe, and various agreements, such as the International Tropical Timber Agreement \\netc., providing that these are aligned with the FAO definition. When applying to be Taxonomy aligned, the \\nspecific definition (if different from FAO) should be set out and the alignment with FAO definition \\ndemonstrated clearly.  \\n\\nFor the purposes of the Taxonomy, significant mitigation achievement for Forestry is judged through \\nimprovement in activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own performance, with a focus on the maintenance of forest carbon stocks and \\nsinks and increase of sequestration potential within the sector. Forests cover around 30% of the global \\nlandmass (in Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide \\neach year.20 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, \\nsupport livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% \\nof the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to \\nthe achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally.21 \\n\\nGiven the necessity to maintain the existing forest carbon sink, conservation finance is enabled within the \\nforest sector, i.e. finance that supports the maintenance and protection of forest areas, regardless of \\nwhether they are used for economic production. The introduction of conservation forests that may have \\nno productive function, into the Taxonomy should aid in the alignment of the Taxonomy as it develops to \\ninclude substantial contribution to other environmental objectives.  \\n\\n18 FAO FRA 2020. \\n\\n \\n\\n19 UN FAO (2019) Global forest resource assessment 2020: terms and definitions FRA.

It is important to recognise that \\nthese two figures are not mutually independent and that the energy end use of forest biomass seldom \\narise solely from whole trees harvested for that purpose. The Taxonomy recognises the principles put \\nforward in the EU Forestry Strategy, advancing both the benefits of sustainable forest management and \\nthe multifunctional role of forests.23  \\n\\nDespite this split between material and energy use, in the context of the bioeconomy the revenue and \\nemployment generated from the two uses is significantly different. 1.8% of the overall EU bioeconomy \\nrevenue is generated from the energetic use of biomass compared to 27% for material production. \\nForestry as an employment sector adds a further 2.2% (EEA, 2018)24.  \\n\\nForests are exposed to the effects of climate change such as changes in weather patterns (e.g. extreme \\nheatwaves), and pest and diseases outbreaks. In Europe alone, more wildfires have been recorded in the \\nfirst four months of 2019 than in the whole of 201825 and while in the EU the forest area is increasing; on \\nthe global scale deforestation remains the second-leading cause of climate change, after the burning of \\nfossil fuels.26 The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates that \\nan additional USD 14 billion in financial flows will be required to address climate impacts in agriculture, \\nforestry and fisheries globally in 2030.27 That includes the implementation of mitigation projects, but also \\nensuring the resilience of forests to climatic changes, the pro-active protection of forest ecosystems, \\nbiodiversity, habitats and soil, as well as the sustainable provision of raw material for the forest-based \\nindustry.

Two forms of \\xe2\\x80\\x98substitution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are foreseen. The substitution of GHG \\nintensive materials with harvested wood products (HWP) (e.g. wood-based raw materials and products \\nused in construction), and the substitution of fossil-based fuels.

At this point, the \\nforest Taxonomy focuses on \\xe2\\x80\\x98greening of\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activities, to protect and enhance forest carbon stocks \\nand sinks. It is recommended that the Commission consider how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenabling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d activities involving \\nlong-lived and harvested wood products could operate within the Taxonomy. A proposal for \\nconsiderations for the Taxonomy set out in Annex F1.  \\n\\nSubjects covered \\n\\nThe scope of the Taxonomy emphasizes carbon sequestration and carbon storage in forests through \\nforest management activities that apply up to the forest gate. The selected activities represent \\ninterventions at different stages of a forest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic life cycle and have been scoped under the NACE \\ncode A2 - Forestry and logging. They include: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Afforestation (FAO FRA 2020 Definition): the establishment of forest through planting and/or \\n\\ndeliberate seeding on land that, until then, was under a different land use, implies a transformation of \\nland use from non-forest to forest. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Reforestation (FAO FRA 2020 Definition): the re-establishment of forest through planting and/or \\ndeliberate seeding on land classified as forest. The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes \\nnatural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to \\nthe increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included \\nexplicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest 31.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Restoration/rehabilitation: any intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an \\n\\necosystem from a degraded state. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Existing forest management: management of land that is reported as forest, in accordance with the \\n\\nSustainable Forest Management principles.

Primary management objectives are exclusive, and area reported under one primary \\nmanagement objective should not  be reported for any other primary management \\nobjectives. \\n\\nc.

Similarly, if there is large-scale harvesting, the NACE category will move from \\nexisting forest management to that of reforestation. Within the EU, reforestation after harvesting is a \\nrequirement, yet this is not the situation globally. The Taxonomy adds value in this way in the global \\ncontext. Conservation forests may arise in a variety of forms (such as designation, or voluntary \\nconservation) and may be considered similar to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexisting forest management\\xe2\\x80\\x9d NACE in the context of \\nthe Taxonomy. The relationship with the other forest NACE is as follows. Where conservation ceases to \\nbe the primary objective of the management of the stand, the NACE will move to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexisting forest \\nmanagement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Where there is a significant loss of forest (for example fire or storm damage), the NACE \\nactivity for ensuring substantial contribution to mitigation will become \\xe2\\x80\\x9creforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crehabilitation/restoration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d until 20 years at which point the NACE will become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconservation forest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d again \\nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexisting forest management\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 depending on the objective of the forest management at that time.  \\n\\nHarvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce the carbon \\nstock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest management activities should be \\neligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and that carbon sinks of above and \\nbelow ground carbon are maintained or  increased, over the rotation period of the forest; or where \\nselective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan. The rotation period is here \\ndefined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest.  \\n\\n \\n\\nCriteria and thresholds \\n\\nSelected criteria build on existing EU legislation (e.g. the Renewable Energy Directive and its recast, EU \\nLULUCF, EU Nature Directives, EU FLEGT, EU Timber Regulation, etc.), national forest legislation, \\ninternational standards and best practices and international processes, such as the Ministerial \\nConference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (Forest Europe). The Taxonomy recognizes that, \\nalthough the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European \\nUnion makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for \\nforests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which \\ninclude a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations.  \\n\\nThe Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure \\nsustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial \\nmitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) (and/or maintained in the case \\nof existing forest management) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable \\nand substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: \\n\\n1.  Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to \\nensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. \\nSFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, \\nthat maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to \\nfulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, \\nand global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.33 The SFM \\nrequirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of \\n\\n33 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  44 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\napproaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply \\ninternationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are \\nregularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors and forest \\nmanagement companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 34 The \\npractices set out in Annex F2 represent a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if \\nimplemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context \\nof maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of \\nthe list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be \\nimplemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests \\nanother practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same \\noutcome. \\n\\nCriterion 1 differs in the context of conservation forests as a result of those forests having a \\ndefined conservation objective and where timber production is not the primary objective. The \\nTaxonomy recognises that its initial goal is to deliver substantial mitigation, and thus for \\nconservation forests focusses on the maintenance of the forest carbon sink. A forest conservation \\nplan is required in order to ensure that substantial mitigation is delivered (in this case \\nmaintenance and increase of carbon sinks) in line with wider conservation objectives. This differs \\nfrom the requirements under the other forest NACE, in that there may be zero intervention \\nrequirements, and/or requires only those management activities listed under Category C in Annex \\nF2.  Any necessary harvesting (for example diseased trees) should be carried out in line with the \\nconservation plan.   \\n\\n2.  Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield \\n\\ncurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG \\nemissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon \\npools (above and below-ground) but recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon \\nmeasurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of \\nabove-ground carbon pools only. \\n \\n\\n3.  Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1 \\n\\nand 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year \\nintervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent \\nauthorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for \\nafforestation and reforestation projects and shall increase over the rotation period for restoration \\nprojects, and be maintained or increased in the case of existing forest management and \\nconservation forests. \\n\\nProgress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a \\nverified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s levels of \\nmaturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. The Taxonomy recognises the \\ncommercial function of forests and the importance of enabling a sustainable finance market in those \\n\\n \\n\\n34 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are \\ncertified by FSC and PEFC.

Therefore, a pragmatic view has been taken to the performance period which differs between \\nforest NACE codes, as set out in Criterion 3 above. For afforestation and reforestation it is recognised \\nthat there will be a measurable increase in carbon stock as the forest stand develops and trees grow. For \\nexisting forest management, and restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages \\nof maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view \\nis taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a \\npoint, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the \\ncommercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. \\nHowever, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual \\nincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.   \\n\\nIn practical terms, for existing forest management and for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest \\nowner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or \\nlandscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, \\nrelative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased \\n(from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but \\nsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocks \\nare being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from \\nfire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE, and \\nperformance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock \\ndevelopment over a period of 20-years.  \\n\\nMeasurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit \\nfrom private investment as the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and existing national frameworks, and \\nrecognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and \\nassessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the \\nnational or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. \\nThe Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to \\nthe national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the \\nholding level as appropriate for the investment.   \\n\\nDo no significant harm to mitigation \\n\\nMitigation activities in the forest Taxonomy focus on the maintenance and increase of the forest carbon \\nsink, whilst reducing and avoiding the GHG emissions from activities. Primary producing sectors, such as \\nforestry are particularly vulnerable to climate-related changes and shocks (e.g. changing weather \\npatterns, heatwaves, etc.). Adaptation of forests is therefore essential if the carbon sinks are to be \\nmaintained, the stocks increased. Adaptation requirements should be framed so as to promote synergies \\nwith substantial mitigation where possible, and as a minimum lead to no significant harm. \\n\\nThe text of the proposed Taxonomy Regulation (Article 12(a)): For the purposes of Article 3(b), an \\neconomic activity shall be considered as significantly harming: (a)  climate change mitigation, where that \\nactivity leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions;  \\n\\nForests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantial carbon sink, and that \\nsignificant harm for forest climate change mitigation include where an (adaptation) activity leads to a \\nsignificant long-term reduction of the carbon sink. It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  46 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nthus forest carbon stocks and sink potential over the long-term. The principles for ensuring mitigation \\nproofed adaptation activities are that adaptation responses should:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Not undermine the long-term ability of the forests to sequester carbon \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Not undermine the long-term maintenance of existing forest carbon sinks, both above and below \\n\\nground \\n\\n \\n\\nA criterion by which the activity can be judged as Taxonomy compliant is as follows \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in line with existing \\nEU legislation: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Adaptation responses shall comply with requirement set out in Article 29(7)b of the recast Renewable \\n\\nEnergy Directive (EU/2018/2001) which determines the requirement for management systems to be \\nin place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are \\nmaintained, or strengthened over the long term35.  \\n\\n \\n\\nImpact of these proposals \\n\\nApproximately 430,000 enterprises are active in wood-based industries across the EU, representing 20% \\nof EU manufacturing enterprises and 7.5% of the gross value-added of the manufacturing industry in \\nEurope.36 The wood industry provides around 3.5 million jobs in the EU.37  Around 60% of EU forests are \\nprivately owned, of which 2/3 have holdings of less than 3 hectares 38, many times fragmented into smaller \\nplots. The structure of private forest ownership is specific and considerable variations exist from country \\nto country, with properties sizes ranging from 0.5 hectares to more than 10,000 hectares, while the \\naverage size is around 13 hectares. Forest owners and managers with similar forest characteristics, \\nunder similar climate conditions and jurisdictions, are expected to be equally impacted.  \\n\\nForestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant \\nHarm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria. This equates to 61.5% \\nof total productive forests in the EU39, and around 20% of productive forests globally.40 Other forests/forest \\n\\n \\n\\n35 Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest \\nare maintained, or strengthened over the long term. This is explicitly defined in Article 29(7)b which requires \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6management \\nsystems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate for \\nthe operation of the Taxonomy and/or investment, rather than relying on national level requirements.  \\n\\n36 In 2017. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Wood_products_-_production_and_trade \\n\\n37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/events/forestry-conference-2019-apr-25_en \\n\\n38 UNECE Geneva Timber And Forest Study Paper 26: Private Forest Ownership in Europe \\n\\n39 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n40 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  47 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nprojects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the \\nmarket with certainty. Whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the \\nDNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including \\ncarbon measurement and performance). \\n\\nProgress and performance in relation to above-ground carbon sequestration is measured relative to the \\nverified baseline, therefore any forest owner/manager is offered the opportunity to progress in accordance \\nwith its specific constrains and maturity level. It is unclear what proportion of the market already \\nimplements carbon sequestration measurements against a verified baseline, but examples of specific \\ncompany progress assessments are available to demonstrate proof of concept.  \\n\\nFrom a reporting perspective the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks. The \\nTaxonomy allows for performance-related information to either be reported and disclosed by the forest \\nowner/forest management company directly, or through existing, integrated reporting mechanisms in \\nplace at the level of the jurisdiction (whether this is at the sourcing area level (multiple holdings)), regional \\nor national level. The Taxonomy recognises the importance of landscape scale approaches i.e. multiple \\nforest stands, in how the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest sink increment is managed \\nand the economic lifetime of forest operations, within which the carbon stock may rise and fall within an \\noverall upward trajectory. The current best-performers are expected to be able to comply with the \\nTaxonomy criteria through their existing reporting and management requirements. It is also recognised \\nthat some will need more time and thus the Taxonomy provides an incentive to improve performance \\nwithin the global forest sector.   \\n\\n \\n\\nNext steps (recommendations to the Platform) \\n\\nThe following issues have not been addressed in this version of the forest Taxonomy criteria. However, \\nthey may provide additional mitigation opportunities for the sector and therefore merit consideration by \\nthe Platform on Sustainable Finance: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy sets out criteria and thresholds for forest management activities that apply up to \\nthe forest gate irrespective of the end-use of the forest products. This is for the pragmatic reason that \\nmany forest managers and owners do not know in which supply chains their products will arise. In \\nprinciple however, the Taxonomy recognises the holistic mitigation potential of forests and wood \\nbeyond the forest gate both through the effect of substitution (replacing more GHG intensive \\nmaterials) and through the long-term carbon sink potential of wood products. Furthermore, the forest \\nTaxonomy deals with the production and supply of forest biomass, but not the demand or end use of \\nthat biomass. The relationship between the end use of biomass and its production, i.e. market pull, is \\nan important component of the overall sustainable finance Taxonomy to consider when incentivising \\ndifferent NACE sectors towards substantial contribution to mitigation. At present climate benefits \\nbeyond the forest gate are expected to be captured through the construction/building, energy and \\nmanufacturing sector Taxonomies, and thus create an incentive for the use of wood in the economy, \\nand thus the management of forests in compliance with the Taxonomy. The Platform should therefore \\nimprove the holistic consideration of forests\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (and forest products) mitigation potential across their \\nentire value chains, and across all sectors of the economy, including end of life. The following \\nrecommendations are made in the context of other NACE sectors:  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  48 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\no  The buildings Taxonomy should consider the following: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xaa  The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in \\n\\nbuildings and construction activities utilising wood. These thresholds should be \\nbased on a wide and consistent set of data able to benchmark best practice \\nacross different building uses and typologies (i.e. houses, flats, offices, etc.). In \\nparallel, the methodology to be used to assess embodied emissions should be \\ndefined in detail on the basis of widely-accepted LCA and CEN/TC350 \\nstandards, with particular care to ensure that the beneficial impact of carbon \\nsequestration in timber products sourced from sustainably-managed forests is \\nadequately recognised. This should include the end of life of wood and \\nconstruction timber. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xaa  Making a subjective view that wood is a prime raw material with climate \\n\\nmitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for construction (as a \\ncriteria for substantial contribution to mitigation). This would aid in incentivising \\nthe use of wood within the economy and for the long-term sequestration of \\ncarbon in timber products. In the current proposals,  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xaa  DNSH for construction using timber is addressed through a requirement for FSC \\n\\nand PECF certification. This is helpful in the short-term, but in the longer-term the \\nplatform should consider ensuring that wood used in construction comes from \\nTaxonomy compliant forests. \\n\\no  The manufacturing Taxonomy should systematically consider the substitution potential of \\nwood as a manufacturing material. Progress has been made in this regard under current \\nNACE 4.7 (Manufacture of other organic base chemicals). This approach is welcomed \\nand should be expanded across other manufacturing NACE sectors. Specifically, it is \\nsuggested that the manufacturing Taxonomy includes NACE C16 (Manufacture of wood \\nand of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and \\nplaiting materials)  and C31 (Manufacture of furniture) and develop robust and verifiable \\nsubstitution criteria (to ensure substantial mitigation) and DNSH criteria (see above \\nproposal for buildings).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSH \\n\\nand as substantial contribution, the Platform should give specific consideration to the use of forest \\nproducts throughout different economic sectors.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The current proposal does not capture or address all possible sources of emissions taking place in \\n\\nthe forest during the lifetime of a forest project or activity. For example, the Taxonomy does not \\naccount for fuel use by machinery within the forest sector (which is currently accounted for in the \\nenergy and transport sectors).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Platform should further explore broadening the current criteria to account for individual \\n\\nimprovements, measures, to be eligible as individual investments towards meeting the overall forest \\nactivity criteria, i.e. the substantial mitigation objective. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  49 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  GHG measurement is required for above-ground carbon sequestration on the basis that below-\\nground carbon is technically more challenging to assess and measure overtime. Instead, below-\\nground carbon shall be maintained and/or increased through a proxy, i.e. the application of \\nmanagement practices, reflected through cumulative Sustainable Forest Management and Do No \\nSignificant Harm requirements. The Platform is advised to further explore below-ground carbon \\nmeasurements and review existing impact assessment methodologies that might complement the \\ncurrent threshold for below-ground carbon measurements. It is further suggested that the Platform \\nconsider the approach to soil-carbon in the agriculture Taxonomy and whether there should be \\nalignment also for the forest Taxonomy.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIt is the view of the TEG that these criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the \\ncriteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification \\napproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly \\naudited. It is recommended that the Platform further develops guidance, including a more granular \\nmapping of the Taxonomy criteria and thresholds, with existing internationally recognised and \\napplicable forest certification schemes. This would provide support to investors and forest \\nmanagement companies and individuals when seeking compliance with the Taxonomy.  \\n\\nIn the context of interlinkages between Taxonomy sectors, the impact of deforestation is often a result \\nof other-sector activities (such as agriculture or building development) rather than forestry. The \\nPlatform are invited to consider whether deforestation is sufficiently addressed in other Taxonomy \\nsectors, in order to support substantial contribution in the forest sector and as a DNSH to mitigation in \\nthe forest sector as enabled through other Taxonomy sectors. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Platform should further explore potential end-user issues and opportunities for investors and \\nfinancial institutions, including potential challenges that may arise in relation to associating capital \\nexpenditures or revenues that can be tagged or screened through the current criteria set for forest \\nmanagement/land use activities. For example, an investor may invest in a wood processing facility, \\nwhich itself is not covered by the current forest Taxonomy sectors, but the operation of the facility will \\ninteract with the management of forests and the use of forest products. Clarity should be provided to \\ninvestors on where and at what point in the value/supply chain they are expected to consider \\ncompliance with the Taxonomy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 specifically for sectors upstream or downstream of the specific \\ninvestment.  \\n\\no  The Platform is invited to consider and develop further the performance period for the \\n\\nexisting forest management NACE. With the proposed Taxonomy for existing forest \\nmanagement, a pragmatic view has been taken to align performance with the commercial \\nrotation period of a forest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 i.e. allowing for changes in carbon stock within a forest and \\nproviding flexibility given that different forests will be harvested at different periods. This \\nimplicitly recognises that the forest will remain forest and when managed under SFM, \\ncontinue to sequester carbon. Importantly this means that the forest may be harvested at \\na commercial point determined by wood quality and quantity and not at a point where the \\nforest has reached a carbon stock saturation point \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which may be considerably longer. \\nThe Platform is therefore asked to consider if it is sufficient to have additionality provided \\nthrough SFM and DNSH, but that for existing forest management substantial contribution \\ncan be judged as the maintenance of the forest carbon stock rather than its increase. \\nWhilst the focus of this Taxonomy is on greening of activities, it may be relevant to \\nconsider the end use of the forest biomass when reflecting on this point \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in that around \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  50 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nhalf of the biomass from EU forests is used for energy purposes, rather than material \\nuses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  51 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n1.1   Afforestation \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nA - Agriculture, forest and silviculture \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\nCode \\n\\n2 \\n\\nA2 \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nAfforestation \\n\\nMitigation criteria \\n\\nPrinciple \\n\\nAfforestation is defined as the establishment of forest through planting and/or \\ndeliberate seeding on land that, until then, was under a different land use, \\nimplies a transformation of land use from non-forest to forest41. \\n\\nAfforestation shall increase carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon in \\ncomparison to a counterfactual with no conversion to forest. \\n\\n \\n\\nAll the Criteria are additive and shall apply together: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest \\n\\nManagement (SFM) requirements: \\n\\no \\n\\nIdentify and apply forest management practices that increase \\nexisting carbon stocks, considering the non-exhaustive list of \\nexamples practices in the Annex F2, however allowing for \\napplication of other similar approaches, that recognise local \\nspecificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil \\nquality, and biodiversity; \\n\\no  Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to \\ndeliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber \\nproduction, etc.);  \\n\\no  Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, \\n\\npeatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or \\nafter January 2008; \\n\\no  Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the \\n\\ncountry of origin42; \\n\\no  Regenerate harvested forests. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant \\n\\ncarbon pools at the beginning of the afforestation/reforestation activity; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable \\nForest Management requirements and increase of carbon sinks from \\nabove and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed \\n\\n41 Source: FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment, 2020 \\n\\n \\n\\n42 Where standards and requirements under national laws are equivalent or better in delivering substantial mitigation, than the SFM \\nrequirements of the Taxonomy.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  52 - \\n\\n\\x0cMetric and \\nThreshold \\n\\n \\n\\nthrough a forest management plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, \\nthat shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or \\ncompetent authorities. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) \\n\\nrequirements is demonstrated and disclosed at 10-year intervals through \\na forest management plan (or equivalent) that shall be reviewed by an \\nindependent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as \\ndescribed in Criteria 3). \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Verified GHG balance baseline43 is calculated for above-ground carbon \\npools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon \\nconvertible.

Selected criteria \\nbuild  on  existing  EU  legislation  and  the  Taxonomy  recognizes  that,  although  the  EU  has  a  variety  of \\nforest-related  policies,  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  makes  no  reference  to \\nspecific  provisions for  an  EU forest  policy, and that  the responsibility for forests lies with the Member \\nStates within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-\\nterm planning in national and regional regulations.  \\n\\nThe Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure \\nsustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial \\nmitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three \\ncriteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in \\norder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and \\nforest services. SFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a \\nway, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality \\nand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social \\nfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other \\necosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.49 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility \\nfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), \\nand apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes \\nthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements.

The aim of the list is to provide support to operators \\nand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different \\nconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can \\nbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock \\n\\nland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use \\nchange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. \\nISCC and RSPO RED).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of \\n\\norigin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law \\nEnforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included \\n\\nas a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside \\nthe EU. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm \\n\\ncriteria. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes \\n\\nthat are regularly audited. \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-\\nyield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and \\nGHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest \\ncarbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. \\nSpecifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) \\nsoil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting \\ncategories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this \\nTaxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. \\nTherefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of above-ground \\ncarbon pools only. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon \\nstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context \\nspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of \\n\\n \\n\\n50 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are \\ncertified by FSC and PEFC.

Using the growth-yield curves, \\ninformation will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the \\nbasis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised \\n1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it \\nrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing \\napproximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon \\ndioxide.  \\n\\n3.  Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria \\n\\n1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year \\nintervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent \\nauthorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years \\nfor afforestation projects.  \\nIn order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy \\naccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the \\ndemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground \\nbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from \\n\\nbelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be \\n\\ndemonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the \\nmeasurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves \\nfrom category \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforest land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining \\ncarbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil \\ncarbon. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that \\n\\nmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national \\nframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing \\napproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These \\ninclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level \\n(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting \\nframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the \\ncompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for \\nthe investment.     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nInternational relevance of the forest Taxonomy \\n\\nIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance \\nwith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification \\napproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  56 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\naudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No \\nSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that \\nvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in \\nthe EU51, and around 20% of productive forests globally.52 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-\\ncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with \\ncertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH \\ncriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including \\ncarbon measurement and performance). \\n\\n \\n\\nAlignment with existing legislation \\n\\nIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider \\nalignment with existing EU legislative instruments and established agreements. The proposed criteria \\nand DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to \\nrecognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where \\nlegislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the \\nrecast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk \\nof using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or \\nsub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to \\nthe Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at \\nforest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed \\nin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article \\n29 does not require an explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the \\ncompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, \\nhowever through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or \\nmanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to \\nestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can \\nbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpact on water resources as well as on water quality; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high \\necological value to forests and illegal logging. \\n\\n \\n\\n51 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n52 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  57 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThe DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest \\nmitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1).

The Forest Taxonomy \\nleaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report.  \\n\\n60 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance \\ncan be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy \\ncriteria. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  61 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nForests cover around 30% of the global landmass (In Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb \\nroughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.61 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, \\nplay an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU \\nforests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon \\nsequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and \\nglobally.62 \\n\\nForests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of \\ncarbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead \\nwood (up to forest gate).  \\n\\nThe forest restoration and forest rehabilitation activities can deliver substantial mitigation through: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  An increase in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground and below ground \\n\\ncarbon pools; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Maintenance and/or increase of the soil quality, soil carbon and biodiversity. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from \\xe2\\x80\\x98afforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98reforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to \\xe2\\x80\\x98existing \\nforest management\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98rehabilitation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule \\nas per Art. 5(3). \\n\\nThe  approach  taken  to  determine metrics  and thresholds  rely  on  cumulative criteria.  Selected criteria \\nbuild  on  existing  EU  legislation  and  the  Taxonomy  recognizes  that,  although  the  EU  has  a  variety  of \\nforest-related  policies,  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  makes  no  reference  to \\nspecific  provisions for  an  EU forest  policy, and that  the responsibility for forests lies with the Member \\nStates within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-\\nterm planning in national and regional regulations.  \\n\\nThe Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure \\nsustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial \\nmitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three \\ncriteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in \\norder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and \\nforest services. SFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a \\nway, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality \\nand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social \\nfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other \\necosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.63 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility \\nfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), \\n\\n \\n\\n61 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/. \\n\\n62 European Forest Institute. \\n\\n63 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  62 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nand apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes \\nthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest \\nowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify \\ncompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.64  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and \\n\\nexisting industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Forestry criteria, the Forest \\nEurope general guidelines for sustainable forest management.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a \\nnon-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement \\nof the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and \\nconservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators \\nand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different \\nconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can \\nbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock \\n\\nland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use \\nchange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. \\nISCC and RSPO RED).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of \\n\\norigin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law \\nEnforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included \\n\\nas a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside \\nthe EU. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm \\n\\ncriteria. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes \\n\\nthat are regularly audited. \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield \\n\\ncurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG \\nemissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon \\npools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. \\nSpecifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) \\nsoil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting \\ncategories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this \\nTaxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. \\nTherefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-ground \\ncarbon pools only. \\n\\n \\n\\n64 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are \\ncertified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  63 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon \\nstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context \\nspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of \\nmaintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest \\ncarbon stocks.   \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and \\n\\nnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, \\ninformation will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the \\nbasis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised \\n1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it \\nrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing \\napproximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon \\ndioxide.  \\n\\n3.  Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to \\n\\ncriterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at \\n10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or \\ncompetent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over the \\nrotation period of the forest for restoration projects. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIn order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy \\naccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the \\ndemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground \\nbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from \\n\\nbelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be \\n\\ndemonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon \\ninventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over \\nthe rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s levels of maturity, \\nclimate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the \\nforest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established \\nforest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the \\ncarbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may \\nreach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of \\nmany forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, \\nproviding the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual \\nincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.  In \\npractical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to \\ndefine the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In \\norder to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the \\nrotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from \\nbaseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but \\nsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon \\nstocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a \\nforest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the \\n\\n \\n\\n-  64 - \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nrestoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the \\nforest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that \\n\\nmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national \\nframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing \\napproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These \\ninclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level \\n(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting \\nframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the \\ncompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for \\nthe investment.     \\n\\nInternational relevance of the forest Taxonomy \\n\\nIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance \\nwith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification \\napproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly \\naudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No \\nSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that \\nvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in \\nthe EU65, and around 20% of productive forests globally.66 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-\\ncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with \\ncertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH \\ncriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including \\ncarbon measurement and performance). \\n\\n \\n\\nAlignment with existing legislation \\n\\nIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider \\nalignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align \\nwith existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation \\nprovides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objectives and where legislation allows for more \\nsubstantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out \\nsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest \\nbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national \\nlaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris \\nagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest \\nsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed \\nin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article \\n\\n \\n\\n65 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n66 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  65 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n29 does not require an explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the \\ncompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, \\nhowever through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or \\nmanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to \\nestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can \\nbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpact on water resources as well as on water quality; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high \\necological value to forests and illegal logging. \\n\\nThe DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest \\nmitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using \\nindependent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a \\nforest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water \\nconsumption at the appropriate level.

All three \\ncriteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in \\norder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and \\nforest services. SFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a \\nway, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality \\nand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social \\nfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other \\necosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.78 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility \\nfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), \\nand apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes \\nthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest \\nowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify \\ncompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.79 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and \\n\\nexisting industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Forestry criteria, the Forest \\nEurope general guidelines for sustainable forest management.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a \\nnon-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement \\nof the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and \\nconservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators \\nand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different \\nconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can \\nbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock \\n\\nland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use \\nchange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. \\nISCC and RSPO RED).  \\n\\n \\n\\n78 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. \\n\\n79 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which \\n20% are certified by FSC and PEFC.

Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield \\n\\ncurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG \\nemissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon \\npools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. \\nSpecifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) \\nsoil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting \\ncategories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this \\nTaxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. \\nTherefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-ground \\ncarbon pools only. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon \\n\\nstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context \\nspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of \\nmaintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest \\ncarbon stocks.   \\nCalculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and \\nnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, \\ninformation will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the \\nbasis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised \\n1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it \\nrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing \\napproximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon \\ndioxide.  \\n \\n\\n3.  Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to \\n\\ncriterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at \\n10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or \\ncompetent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period \\nof 20 years for reforestation projects. \\nIn order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy \\naccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the \\ndemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground \\nbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  72 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be \\n\\ndemonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the \\nmeasurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves \\nfrom category \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforest land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining \\ncarbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil \\ncarbon. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that \\n\\nmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national \\nframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing \\napproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These \\ninclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level \\n(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting \\nframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the \\ncompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for \\nthe investment.     \\n\\n \\n\\nInternational relevance of the forest Taxonomy \\n\\nIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance \\nwith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification \\napproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly \\naudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No \\nSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that \\nvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in \\nthe EU80, and around 20% of productive forests globally.81 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-\\ncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with \\ncertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH \\ncriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including \\ncarbon measurement and performance). \\n\\n \\n\\nAlignment with existing legislation \\n\\nIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider \\nalignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align \\nwith existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation \\n\\n \\n\\n80 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n81 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  73 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nprovides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more \\nsubstantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out \\nsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest \\nbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national \\nlaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris \\nagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest \\nsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed \\nin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article \\n29 does not require an explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the \\ncompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, \\nhowever through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or \\nmanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to \\nestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can \\nbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpact on water resources as well as on water quality; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high \\necological value to forests and illegal logging. \\n\\nThe DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest \\nmitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using \\nindependent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a \\nforest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water \\nconsumption at the appropriate level.

SFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a \\nway, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality \\nand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social \\nfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other \\necosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.92 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility \\nfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), \\nand apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes \\nthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest \\nowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify \\ncompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.93 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and \\n\\nexisting industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Forestry criteria, the Forest \\nEurope general guidelines for sustainable forest management.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a \\nnon-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement \\nof the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and \\nconservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators \\nand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different \\nconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can \\nbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock \\n\\nland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use \\nchange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. \\nISCC and RSPO RED).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of \\n\\norigin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law \\nEnforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included \\nas a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside \\nthe EU. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm \\n\\ncriteria. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes \\n\\nthat are regularly audited. \\n\\n \\n\\n92 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. \\n\\n93 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are \\ncertified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  79 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield \\n\\ncurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG \\nemissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon \\npools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. \\nSpecifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) \\nsoil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting \\ncategories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this \\nTaxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. \\nTherefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-ground \\ncarbon pools only. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon \\n\\nstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context \\nspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of \\nmaintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest \\ncarbon stocks.   \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and \\n\\nnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, \\ninformation will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the \\nbasis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised \\n1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it \\nrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing \\napproximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon \\ndioxide.  \\n\\n3.  Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria \\n\\n1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year \\nintervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent \\nauthorities. A description of state of play is required every 10 years to ensure steady and \\noverall progress is aimed for and achieved. That aligns with management cycles time horizons \\nperformed in the EU as well as National Forest Inventories, performed on a 10-year basis.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIn order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy \\naccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the \\ndemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground \\nbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from \\nbelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be \\n\\ndemonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon \\ninventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over \\nthe rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s levels of maturity, \\nclimate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the \\nforest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established \\nforest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the \\n\\n \\n\\n-  80 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ncarbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may \\nreach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of \\nmany forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, \\nproviding the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual \\nincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.  In \\npractical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to \\ndefine the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In \\norder to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the \\nrotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from \\nbaseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but \\nsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon \\nstocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a \\nforest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the \\nrestoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the \\nforest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that \\n\\nmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national \\nframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing \\napproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These \\ninclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level \\n(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting \\nframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the \\ncompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for \\nthe investment.     \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Harvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce the \\n\\ncarbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest management \\nactivities should be eligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and that \\ncarbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or  increased, over the rotation \\nperiod of the forest; or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forest \\nconservation plan. The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting or \\nnatural regeneration through to the point of harvest.  \\n\\n \\n\\nInternational relevance of the forest Taxonomy \\n\\nIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance \\nwith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification \\napproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly \\naudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No \\nSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that \\nvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in \\nthe EU94, and around 20% of productive forests globally.95 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-\\n\\n \\n\\n94 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n95 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  81 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with \\ncertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH \\ncriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including \\ncarbon measurement and performance). \\n\\n \\n\\nAlignment with existing legislation \\n\\nIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider \\nalignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align \\nwith existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation \\nprovides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more \\nsubstantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out \\nsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest \\nbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national \\nlaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris \\nagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest \\nsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed \\nin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article \\n29 does not require an explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the \\ncompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, \\nhowever through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or \\nmanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to \\nestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can \\nbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpact on water resources as well as on water quality; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nimpacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high \\necological value to forests and illegal logging. \\n\\nThe DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest \\nmitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using \\nindependent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a \\nforest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\nRefer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change \\nadaptation.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water \\nconsumption at the appropriate level.

Calculating the GHG balance baseline \\nrequires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees. \\nUsing the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual \\nincrement in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG \\nbalance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the \\nRevised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas \\nInventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the \\namount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing \\napproximately 0,5 ton of carbon.

Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy \\nleaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report.  \\n\\n102 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural \\ndisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the \\nTaxonomy criteria. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  86 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nGiven the objectives of the Taxonomy, conservation finance should be enabled within the forest sector \\nand conservation forest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which may have no productive value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recognised for their carbon sink role. \\nIt is therefore proposed that conservation forests are recognised in the Taxonomy, provided they can \\ndemonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forest \\ncarbon sink. \\n\\n \\n\\nConservation  forests  are  that  in  which  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98primary  designated  management  objective\\xe2\\x80\\x99  (FAO  FRA \\ndefinition)  is  that  of  conservation.

EU  forests  already  account  for  more  than  20%  of  the  global  forest  carbon  sink,  and  yet  an \\nincrease in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by \\n2050 in Europe and globally.105 \\n\\nForests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of \\ncarbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead \\nwood (up to forest gate). .  \\n\\nConservation forestry activities can deliver substantial mitigation through: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  An increase in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground and below ground \\n\\ncarbon pools; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Maintenance and/or increase of the soil quality, soil carbon and biodiversity. \\n\\nThe Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from \\xe2\\x80\\x98conservation forest\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to \\xe2\\x80\\x98existing forest \\nmanagement\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if the objectives of the forest management change; or to \\xe2\\x80\\x98restoration/rehabilitation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98reforestation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 should there be the loss of forest from force majeure.  \\n\\nThe approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria \\nbuild on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of \\nforest-related  policies,  the  Treaty  on  the Functioning  of the  European Union  makes  no  reference  to \\nspecific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member \\nStates within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-\\nterm planning in national and regional regulations.  \\n\\nThe Taxonomy sets out the following qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure a \\nmeasured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation \\nis cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three  criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable \\nand substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: \\n\\n \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in \\norder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest conservation. \\nSFM is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x98the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a \\nrate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their \\npotential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at \\nlocal, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems\\xe2\\x80\\x99.106 \\nThe SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the \\nadoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and \\n\\n \\n\\n104 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/. \\n\\n105 European Forest Institute. \\n\\n106 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  88 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\napply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that \\nare regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest \\nowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify \\ncompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally.107  For conservation forests, only the \\nmanagement activities listed under Category C in Annex F2 are required.  \\n \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-\\n\\nyield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to be maintained \\nor increased and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly \\nconsiders all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF \\nregulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground \\nbiomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested \\nwood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, \\nwhich is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-\\nground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on \\nthe measurement of above-ground carbon pools only. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon \\nstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context \\nspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms \\nof maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest \\ncarbon stocks.   \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and \\n\\nnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation).

Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM \\nand Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion \\ncriteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive \\nforests in the EU108, and around 20% of productive forests globally.109 Other forests/forest projects \\n(i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market \\nwith certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the \\nDNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required \\n(including carbon measurement and performance). \\n\\n \\n\\nAlignment with existing legislation \\n\\nIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider \\nalignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements \\nalign with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where \\nlegislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for \\nmore substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out \\nsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach  to minimise the risk of using forest \\nbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national \\nlaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris \\nagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest \\nsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria \\nproposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is \\nthat Article 29 does not require an explicit \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, \\nthe compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-\\nbased, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws \\n\\n \\n\\n108 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC \\nInternational, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n109 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  90 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nor management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed.

Enabling activities are defined in the Taxonomy Political Agreement Article 11(a) of December \\n2019 as \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to one or more of the \\nenvironmental objectives set out in Article 5 by directly enabling other activities to make a substantial \\ncontribution to one or more of those objectives, and where that activity:  \\n(a) does not lead to a lock-in in assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering the \\neconomic lifetime of those assets; (b) has a substantial positive environmental impact on the basis of \\nlifecycle considerations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn simple terms, the current forest taxonomy \\nrecognises activities that provide substantial \\nmitigation up to the forest gate. An \\nenablingapproach would recognise where forest-\\nbased products from the forest sector are \\nsupporting substantial mitigation beyond the \\nforest gate, i.e. in other sectors of the economy.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 6 provides a simplified schematic of this \\nrelationship.  \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 6: Schematic of greening of & by i.e. enabling in the Forestry Taxonomy \\n\\nRationale for forestry as an enabling activity \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Forestry provides a range of services to society, such as material, non-material (barriers), renewable \\n\\nenergy and environmental services \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the bioeconomy \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The replacement of GHG intensive materials and energy in the wider economy relies on other sectors \\n\\nto provide fibre for substitution, which implicates demand and response from the forest sector, which \\ncurrently has only limited recognition in current accounting frameworks (e.g. LULUCF Regulation).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Further recognising the role of forest-based products in the wider process of transitioning to the green \\neconomy could incentivise the sector in a positive way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 generating demand for Taxonomy compliant \\nforestry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and thus deliver cross sector incentives for substantial contribution to mitigation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  93 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Exploring the way to introduce an enabling approach could also help ensure that private sector \\n\\nfinancing of the use of forest-based products is driving towards the use of more sustainable products \\nand production and, importantly, more sustainable end uses.  \\n\\n \\n\\nKey challenges \\n\\nValorisation of the forest-based products contribution in the down-stream sector. The principles of \\nthe circular economy look towards the designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials \\nin use, and regenerating natural systems. Therefore, forest-based products that have already been used \\nwithin an economic sector other than forestry should become part of the circular economy and contribute \\nin another sector \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the aim to keep the wood in its material form for as long as possible before \\ndisposal and/or energy recovery. This follows the principle of resource efficiency (EU Forest Strategy \\ndescribed it as: using forest resources in a way that minimises the impact on the environment and \\nclimate, and prioritising the forest outputs that have higher added-value, create more jobs and contribute \\nto a better carbon balance). This raises a key question as to the point at which the forest-based sector \\nwould be recognised for the initial material production (as a means of substantial contribution), and to \\ncontribute to substitution in multiple sectors (where the same wood is used) for their decarbonisation.   \\n\\n \\n\\nDifferent Forest NACE. The current proposal for a Forest Taxonomy includes five NACE sector \\ndistinctions, Afforestation, Reforestation, Rehabilitation/restoration, Existing Forest Management and \\nConservation Forests. Would it be necessary to establish a link between the use of wood products in \\nanother economy NACE and a specific forest sector NACE? If so, which one as all form part of the forest \\nmanagement system? How would this be done, and what if a product is used in multiple NACE categories \\n(how to count the multiple substitution). \\n\\n \\n\\nTrans NACE reporting, traceability and compliance.  The use of forest-based products in one sector of \\nthe economy may be supported through a separate investor (say for building regeneration) who is not \\ninvesting in the forest sector. The forest sector producers, especially the owners mostly do not always \\nknow the end-use of the wood products passing beyond the forest gate. However, there would need to be \\nin place some form of traceability and chain of custody to ensure compliance, for example exploring how \\ninformation from the  HWP category in the LULUCF Regulation could be used.  \\n\\n \\n\\nEnabling and supply. Do enabling activities by default need to arise from a sector/supply that is \\ntaxonomy eligible/compliant in the context of significant contribution? For example, if wood used in \\nconstruction of a building is recognised as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenabling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the source of the wood would need to be taxonomy \\naligned within the forest sector. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  94 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nGHG emissions. Regarding enabling activities within the manufacturing sector, no criteria on the GHG \\nemissions from manufacturing are given because the benefits these lead to are considered to outweigh \\ntheir emissions. For Forestry, this would be consistent with the current IPCC Guidelines (Emissions are \\nattributed at the point of harvest and thus in the forest sector). However, the large-scale adoption of wood \\nenergy or wood material use could lead to an increased drain on the existing forest carbon sink \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and \\nmay thus warrant safeguards.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMultiple enablers. The end use of wood is highly varied, with both different fractions of the wood used in \\ndifferent resource streams, and different products or end uses generated at different stages (Figure 7). \\nHow and at what point in the wood flow would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreening by\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be defined, or it should be counted at each \\npoint when it substitutes non-renewable resources?  \\n\\nFigure 7: Sankey diagram of main wood flows in the EU. Blanke & Mantau 2016 \\n\\n \\n\\nOpportunities from existing practice \\n\\n \\n\\nDespite the potential challenges to the Taxonomy for including a more holistic approach to the use of \\nwood products in the wider economy, there are a number of cases where operators have been able to \\ndevelop approaches to tracking or estimating the substation effects and benefits of forest products in the \\nwider economy. These demonstrate proof of concept for a wider applicability of the forest Taxonomy than \\nfocussing only on the management of forests up to the forest gate.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe TEG has received various documents in this regard, including information provided by Stora Enso \\nand SCA (a Swedish publicly listed forest products company) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both demonstrate the added value (in \\nclimate terms) of forest products in the overall economy through substitution effects. The point of \\ncontention within the forest sector is that the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accounting of the climate benefits from forestry are not \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  95 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nfully attributed in the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GHG accounts to forestry as a sector. i.e. the substitution effects are not \\nattributed to the sector, only the emissions of logging. They do however point out that in the UNFCCC \\naccounts, all the benefits are recognised, but that substation would be recognised in a separate sector \\nthan forestry. They go on in the report to demonstrate a feasible calculation approach for substitution \\nbenefits that could be applied by businesses that are collecting the necessary information. Some \\nelements of this approach would need to be further validated, such as the specific calculation of the \\nsubstitution effect itself \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as this is based on a conversion factor for three product groups. These may be \\naccurate, conservative or inaccurate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but what is clear is that they are not a direct measurement, but an \\nassumed substitution level. This may be ok, but worth recognising. \\n\\n \\n\\nOverall therefore it would seem possible for the forest industry or specific businesses to be able to \\ncalculate the substitution effect of forest products arising in the forest sector (as defined in the Taxonomy) \\nbut delivering substitution benefits in other economy sectors. The question still remains to which NACE \\nsector the benefits arising from the use of wood should be attributed? The logic of the taxonomy overall \\nsuggests that this should still be in the sector that takes the raw material and processes it into something \\nwhich will deliver substitution, or utilises that material (or energy) in substitute for another. It would seem \\ninappropriate to recognise the felling of trees, i.e. the provision of the raw material as an enabling activity \\nper se. It is recognised, however, that forest-products arise from a renewable resource, rather than the \\nfinite resources of the extractive industries.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIdeas on a possible enabling approach \\n\\nWithin the manufacturing TEG, the Taxonomy already recognises enabling activities. These are \\nrecognised on the basis of the principal of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in \\nsubstantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) is \\neligible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It is therefore the production of something that would lead to substantial GHG emission \\nreductions in other sectors. In this context, components of renewable energy infrastructure are cited, \\namongst others. The line between the manufacture of an essential product for decarbonisation and \\nsubstantial mitigation, is clear. Forest products are slightly different. Wood materials and energy are not \\nnecessarily essential components of low-carbon technology, in that a house or furniture is not necessarily \\nlow-carbon if it is made from wood. The key identifying feature for wood products is one of substitution, \\nwhether another low(er)-carbon product could be used or whether there are other forms of energy (or \\ndemand reduction) that would be more carbon beneficial. Therefore, the logical link for \\xe2\\x80\\x98greening by\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of \\nthe forest sector would need to be able to demonstrate something like the following criteria:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The product that has been substituted was essential to the low-carbon performance of the sector in \\n\\nwhich it is used \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The product that has been substituted was of a higher GHG/carbon intensity than the substitute \\n\\nwoody biomass (Thresholds could be proposed] \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  That primary manufacturing was necessary and could not have been substituted from the recovery \\n\\nand re-use or recycling of existing products, including wood-based products.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  96 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  That alternative forms of renewable energy, such as Solar PV or Wind could not have been utilised \\n\\ninstead / or have been subverted through the use of woody biomass.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn light of the design of the overall Taxonomy (activity based) and the fact that the substitution effect can \\nonly be judged in an end-use sector (i.e. at the product level) it is challenging to produce a \\xe2\\x80\\x98greening by\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\napproach that can be implemented through the forest Taxonomy alone. As such, it is proposed that the \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98greening of\\xe2\\x80\\x99 through the use of forest products, is addressed through those sectors that utilise those \\nforest products (i.e. end use or intermediary sectors), such as manufacturing or buildings. Specific \\nrecommendations to other Taxonomy sectors (Buildings and Manufacturing) are made in the preamble to \\nthe forest Taxonomy, and not repeated here. These can be summarised as follows:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in activities utilising wood. This \\n\\nshould include the end of life of wood and construction timber. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The development of robust and verifiable substitution criteria to determine when wood use makes a \\n\\nsubstantial contribution to mitigation, and when not.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Sectors using long-lived wood products should make a subjective view that wood is a prime raw \\n\\nmaterial with climate mitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for use in the \\neconomy. This must be accompanied by robust DNSH criteria to ensure that the demand for forest \\nproducts does not lead to impacts on the forest resources. The future Taxonomy should ensure that \\nwood used in other sectors to deliver substantial contribution to mitigation, is also compliant with the \\nforest Taxonomy.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSH \\n\\nand as substantial contribution, specific consideration should be made to the use of forest products \\nthroughout different economic sectors.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n ANNEX F2 indicative and recommended forest management practices that maintain and/or \\nincrease carbon stores or carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon (as per Criterion 1 of \\nthe Forest Taxonomy) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  97 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCategory \\n\\n \\n\\nIndicative examples of types of practices that could be considered \\nfor all the relevant carbon pools112.   \\n\\nApplicability per activity113 (AF, RE, FR, MF), if not specifically mentioned, \\npractice applies to all. \\n\\nA.

AGRICULTURE  \\n\\nWhy agriculture is addressed in the Taxonomy \\n\\nAgriculture is the management of the natural environment, plants and animals to produce and process \\nfood, feed, fibre, fuel and other products. As a sector, it plays a central role in climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment and food security. It is projected that by 2050 the global population will increase to 10 billion, \\nresulting in a 50% increase in the demand for food. However, even at present, the food supply chain \\ncontributes 19-29% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the majority of which, for most supply \\nchains, occurs at the farm level (80-90%). In the EU, 10% of GHG emissions are attributed to \\nagriculture.124 This alone presents opportunities for significant climate change mitigation. However, \\nagriculture differs from other sectors when considering climate change mitigation as it can act as both a \\nsource and a sink for GHG emissions. Soil carbon and biomass (trees, shrubs and grasslands) are also \\nrelevant as major pools of carbon. For this reason, agriculture has the potential to be a net positive sector \\nfrom an emissions perspective. At the same time, agricultural productivity is simultaneously vulnerable to \\nclimate change (including, but not limited to, heat stress, drought, flooding, changes in seasonality and \\nextreme weather events) and central to supporting adaptation and resilience through its provision of \\necosystem services and income for billions of households worldwide. \\n\\nSubjects covered  \\n\\nThe following economic activities are explicitly addressed in the Taxonomy: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Growing of non-perennials: including cereals, rice, leguminous crops and oil seeds, vegetables, \\n\\nmelons, roots and tubers, sugar cane and fibre crops;  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Growing of perennials: including grapes, tropical and sub-tropical fruits, citrus fruits, stone fruits, \\n\\nother tree and bush fruits and nuts, oleaginous fruits, beverage crops, spices, aromatics and drug \\nand pharmaceutical crops, grass leys; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Animal production: including dairy and other cattle and buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry \\n\\nand the management of their waste (manure) and related grassland or pasture. \\n\\nIn addition, mixed farming, where combinations of the above activities are carried out on a farm holding, \\ncan be addressed via the application of the relevant thresholds and criteria from these same three \\nactivities. For the purpose of the Taxonomy, mixed farming involves any operation with both livestock and \\ncrop production. Crops grown in mixed farming can be grown either to feed livestock or for separate sale \\nas a cash crop. In assessing mixed farming operations, cropland production should be screened using \\ncriteria for growing of non-perennials (e.g. if vineyards or orchards are included) or perennial crops (e.g. if \\na farm grows cereals). Livestock production should be assessed according to the animal production \\ncriteria. It is important to note that recoupling of crops and livestock can lead to greater resource \\nefficiency and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs, thus improving climate and environmental \\n\\n124 2015 figure taken from  \\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Archive:Agri \\nenvironmental_indicator_greenhouse_gas_emissions \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  102 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nperformance125. At the same time, if accompanied by productivity improvement on existing agricultural \\nlands, mixed farming reduces the expansion pressures of agriculture into non cultivated/used land. The \\nrecoupling of crop and livestock production is a systemic change which is beneficial and feasible in many \\ncontexts, but it is not a mandatory requirement of the Taxonomy.   \\n\\nSetting criteria and thresholds \\n\\nAs noted above, agriculture can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions. However, it may not \\nbe possible to reach net negative emissions in every instance of agricultural activity or on every farm, \\nparticularly those that are specialised in nature and/or have low carbon stocking capacity. Therefore, the \\nTaxonomy does not require the demonstration of net negative emissions at the activity or farm level, but \\ninstead requires that the following three criteria must all be met for agricultural activities to be recognised \\nas delivering substantial contributions to mitigation:  \\n\\n1.  Reduced emissions from ongoing land and animal management.  \\n\\n2. \\n\\nIncreased removals of carbon from the atmosphere and storage in above- and below-ground \\nbiomass through ongoing land and animal management, up to the limit of saturation levels.  \\n\\n3.  The agricultural activity is not being carried out on land that was previously deemed to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98of high \\n\\ncarbon stock\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  \\n\\nThe lack of deep GHG reporting datasets from which to establish best performance benchmarks, coupled \\nwith the lack of emissions budgets or sequestration targets for the agricultural sector at either the EU or \\nglobal level, meant it was not possible to set robust absolute GHG thresholds for either criteria 1 or 2. \\nFurthermore, given the high degree of heterogeneity across the agricultural sector (in terms of production \\nsystem, crop or livestock type, farm size, environmental and biophysical conditions, etc.), it was felt to be \\ninappropriate to do so.  \\n\\nHowever, requiring a relative GHG improvement compared to an \\xe2\\x80\\x98own-farm counterfactual\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is workable \\nwithin this context of high heterogeneity. For criteria 1, emissions reductions targets as a percentage of \\nthat counterfactual have been established using studies of the emissions reductions needed across the \\nagricultural sector as whole over time. For criteria 2, recognising that carbon stocking potential is highly \\nvariable across different land parcels, but that carbon sequestration represents a large mitigation potential \\navailable to the agriculture sector, a simpler requirement has been set \\xe2\\x80\\x93 simply that carbon stocks are \\nincreased over a 20-year period \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which recognises that preventing ongoing carbon losses and \\nincreasing sequestration is viable to make a substantial contribution in this case. It is noted, however, that \\nthe studies on emissions reduction paths are limited in number and therefore the criteria would benefit \\nfrom greater clarity on the precise transition needed in the agriculture sector to contribute to a net-zero \\neconomy in 2050. \\n\\nIn addition, recognising that relative GHG improvement targets are a fairly blunt instrument and require \\nfarm level GHG accounting, which is not yet widespread, an additional, alternative approach is proposed. \\nNamely, demonstration of the deployment of a specified bundle of land and, if appropriate, animal \\nmanagement practices across the production area. From a review of the scientific literature, these \\npractices have been selected because they deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty \\n\\n125 https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/sites/agri-eip/files/fg16_mixed_farming_final-report_2017_en.pdf  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  103 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nacross a range of biophysical and farming conditions. They should therefore be widely applicable and \\nprovide a more directly communicable approach to farmers, although this would benefit from testing with \\nkey stakeholders globally, including small- and large-scale farmers. It will, of course, be necessary to \\nregularly review this list of practices to integrate new advances in scientific knowledge.  \\n\\nTo maximise usability, it is left open to the user whether they demonstrate i) emissions reductions and \\nincreased sequestration directly or, alternatively, ii) the deployment of the specified bundle of practices \\nthat have been deemed to represent a substantial contribution to mitigation. Whichever approach is \\ntaken, three yearly audits are required to demonstrate ongoing compliance with the criteria and \\nthresholds. This is to address the multi-year timeframes over which emissions reductions and carbon \\nstocking can occur and acknowledges the risks to the permanence of carbon stocks. The establishment \\nof a pool of proxy indicators for compliance with these Criteria (such as vetted and approved existing \\nstandards, certification schemes, carbon credit schemes and similar) would greatly facilitate uptake of \\nand disclosure against the Criteria. \\n\\nRecognising the potential for agricultural production to enable substantial mitigation in other \\nsectors \\n\\nIt is noted that besides supplying food and feed, agriculture has the potential to (and increasingly does) \\nsupply biomass to be used as raw materials for the bioeconomy including textiles, biobased materials for \\nindustry, construction and packaging, and bioenergy. Biomaterials can have longer life-cycles than food \\nand feed products, and therefore can contribute to longer-term removal and sequestration of carbon. \\nBioenergy can displace emissions from burning fossil fuels. Agricultural production can therefore enable \\nmitigation through other economic activities.  \\n\\nThe criteria presented here focus on the substantial mitigation that can be realised in the way these crops \\nand resources are produced, regardless of their end use. They do not take into account any contribution \\nthat agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy. The Platform is asked to consider \\nthis aspect further to determine whether and under what circumstances these or alternative criteria for \\n(some) agricultural production or producers might be appropriate in light of potential substantial \\ncontributions they can enable in downstream economic activities that are part of the bioeconomy.  \\n\\nAligning with regulations \\n\\nFor clarification, the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) includes a number of sustainability \\nrequirements relating to the production of the feedstock used to produce bioenergy, and these agricultural \\ncriteria are consistent with those requirements which can be applied across agricultural producers for \\ntheir production of food, bioenergy and biomaterials for various supply chains.  \\n\\nThese criteria also take guidance from, and look to build on, the cross compliance measures of the \\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP), and in particular the current proposals for the post-2020 CAP per \\nAnnex III of COM(2018)392126.   \\n\\n126 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:aa85fa9a-65a0-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1.0003.02/DOC_2&format=PDF \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  104 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nAs a general principle, the working group has aimed to ensure that the \\xe2\\x80\\x98do no significant harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99 criteria in \\nparticular are aligned with the conditionality requirements, that is, the criteria that farmers must meet to \\nbecome eligible for CAP subsidies.  The \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 criteria go beyond these requirements \\nas this was felt to be necessary to meet the scale of impact required to count as a substantial \\ncontribution.  The working group focussed on the post-2020 CAP rather than the current CAP to \\xe2\\x80\\x98future-\\nproof\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as much as possible these criteria.  Efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the \\npost-2020 CAP but the working group is cognisant that the post-2020 CAP has not been adopted at this \\ntime, and the Commission and, subsequently the Platform on Sustainable Finance (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Platform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), is \\nrequested to review the provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether any \\nchanges would need to be made to these Criteria based on that.  \\n\\nAddressing synergies and potential co-benefits in agricultural production \\n\\nThe interrelated nature of land management decisions and the impact on soil, water, biodiversity and \\ncarbon cycles means that the management of agricultural land for one objective of the Taxonomy (e.g. \\nclimate mitigation) will have an impact on other objectives of the Taxonomy (e.g. protection of healthy \\necosystems). The Taxonomy is set up to ensure that, for economic activities that are compliant with the \\nTaxonomy, a substantial contribution to mitigation in the agriculture sector, does not come at the expense \\nof significant harm to the other five  environmental objectives. However, the interrelated nature of these \\nenvironmental goals actually offers the opportunity to develop substantial mitigation approaches that not \\nonly do no harm to other Taxonomy objectives but also deliver or enable positive contributions to other \\nTaxonomy objectives.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, climate mitigation cannot, should not, and has not been, considered in isolation from \\nthe other five environmental objectives of the Taxonomy. Many of the measures included in the best-\\npractice tables for substantial contribution to mitigation criteria are agro-ecological practices or nature-\\nbased land management activities (e.g. crop rotation, planting hedges), which are win-win or no-regret \\nmeasures. While they contribute substantially to climate mitigation, they also have significant benefits for \\nsoil health, biodiversity, resource efficiency and water protection and thereby increase resilience against \\nclimatic extremes. In other cases, the synergies with other objectives need to be more carefully pursued \\nand considerations made that are often context-specific. In particular with respect to livestock production, \\nsynergies with sustainability objectives has required careful consideration and balancing productivity / \\nintensity of production with increasing biodiversity value and improving water quality.    \\n\\n \\n\\nThe proposed criteria for agricultural production activities have been developed on the basis of enabling \\nsystemic transition over time. This has in part been pursued so as to prevent system lock-in whereby an \\nimmediate action for mitigation prevents or closes down future options for change that could deliver \\ngreater mitigation benefits in the sector. For example, the investment in activities that seek to improve the \\nGHG performance of the livestock sector should not prevent more systemic changes in the sector \\nthrough, for example, greater integration of livestock and crop production (mixed farming), or overall \\nreduction in livestock production. Another example can be taken from the perspective of the use and \\nproduction of biofuels for the transport sector. Whilst more sustainable liquid biofuels have allowed GHG \\nemission reductions from transport energy, they perpetuate the use of internal combustion engines in a \\nmitigation development trajectory that may seek more substantial changes, such as electrification of \\nvehicles, or modal shift.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  105 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nBrief overview of public consultation feedback \\n\\nThe TEG thanks all respondents who provided feedback to help improve the agriculture criteria for the \\nTaxonomy. The working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in developing this \\nreport. The following brief summary highlights the key feedback received and the response to it.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Stakeholders raised the option of an alternative, more principles-based approach to setting \\n\\ncriteria, based on for example agro-ecological principles.  This approach was considered by the \\nworking group, but was felt to be too open-ended to enable a set of criteria to be applied \\nconsistently by all users, leading to a high risk of significant variation in levels of performance.  \\nHowever, it is the view of the TEG that the criteria (and specifically the best practices detailed \\nhere) align with those principles, and allow sufficient flexibility in their application to meet a variety \\nof user circumstances, while at the same time requiring a consistent level of performance across \\nusers. \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  A number of stakeholders noted the need for consistency with existing regulation.  In response, \\n\\nefforts have been made to reference to existing EU regulation that aligns with these criteria where \\nit exists.  This is particularly the case for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98do no significant harm\\xe2\\x80\\x99 criteria. As noted above \\nhowever, that a number of these criteria relating to \\xe2\\x80\\x98a substantial contribution to mitigation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are \\nconsistent with, but go beyond, existing regulation.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  A large number of points of feedback were received on specific best practices.  These have been \\n\\nreviewed and considered in depth and changes made to the criteria accordingly following expert \\nconsultation.  This includes, but is not limited to, addressing emissions embedded in livestock \\nfeed, and reconsidering the best practice relating to tillage.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Some stakeholders raised concerns around animal welfare and health status. These do not fall \\n\\nunder the environmental goals of the Taxonomy at this time and therefore were not within the \\nAgricultural Working Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remit. However, a recommendation has been made to the Platform \\nto integrate criteria addressing these factors at the earliest possible date.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Lastly, a number of stakeholders raised concerns over the difficulty in demonstrating compliance \\n\\nwith these criteria.  This challenge is recognised by the working group.  To assist in addressing \\nthis, the working group has requested that the Platform work with existing agricultural standards, \\ncertification schemes, carbon schemes and others to map consistency of requirements between \\nthose schemes and these criteria, with the aim of establishing a pool of proxy indicators that can \\nbe taken as evidence of compliance with these criteria.  \\n\\n \\n\\nImpact of these proposals127 \\n\\n \\n\\n127 All data relates to 2016, unless otherwise stated.

In 2016 one quarter (25.1%) of these farms are specialist \\nlivestock farms and just over half (52.5%) are specialist crop farms, the rest are composed of mixed \\nfarming (21.1%)128. \\n\\nMost of these farms are small in nature, with two-thirds less than 5 ha in size. But the largest 3.3% of \\nthem (those over 100 ha in size) manage just over half (52.7%) of all farmland.  \\n\\nAgriculture contributed 1.2% to the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP in 2017, even without considering its importance as the key \\nbuilding block for the downstream food and beverages processing industry. It employs 9.7 million people, \\njust over 4% of the working population, but these statistics vary significantly by country. In Romania, for \\nexample, nearly a quarter of the working population work in agriculture, and numbers are also high in \\nBulgaria, Greece and Poland. \\n\\nThe agricultural sector in the EU invested EUR 57.2 billion in 2017. \\n\\nGlobal applicability \\n\\nGiven the heterogeneity of agriculture, it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria. This \\npoint was raised in the public consultation feedback.  However, it is the view of the TEG that these criteria \\nare globally relevant for low carbon agriculture and with the in-built flexibility on options for demonstrating \\ncompliance, they can be applied globally.  To assist with this, the criteria are not tied to specific EU \\nregulations, though cross-reference is made where appropriate to those regulations to assist EU users.   \\n\\nNext steps \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recommendations to the Platform \\n\\n1.  Within and across these economic activities, the following are not (yet) addressed in this round of \\n\\nTaxonomy criteria but represent significant opportunities for emissions reductions across the \\nagricultural sector as a whole. These opportunities would merit additional consideration by the \\nPlatform: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Taking land completely out of agricultural production for the purposes of restoring or re-\\nestablishing natural habitats, particularly peatland and other carbon rich landscapes, or \\nintegrating structural elements (such as hedges, buffer strips, woody landscape features) into \\nagricultural land. There are a number of known benefits such practices, including increased \\ncarbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion and nutrient loss, and via its positive impact on \\nbiodiversity, support pollination and pest control. The challenge faced when considering whether \\na \\xe2\\x80\\x98land out of production\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and/or \\xe2\\x80\\x98integration of structural elements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 practice should be required is \\nsetting an ambitious but implementable target. Relevant questions are: what proportion of land \\nshould be covered, how should it be covered, how would this be balanced with other objectives \\n(such as food production) and how could permanence be ensured. Further, given the high co-\\nbenefits and inter-relations of such  practice across mitigation, biodiversity and general \\necosystem health, it is also debatable whether such practices most appropriately fits under \\nsubstantial contribution to mitigation or substantial contribution to healthy ecosystems. The \\n\\n128 Source: Eurostat (ef_m_farmleg) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  107 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nPlatform are therefore invited to consider how and by what criteria, land should be taken out of \\nproduction and under what substantial contribution category this would best be classified.    \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Switching from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities. For example, reducing cattle \\n\\nnumbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein, with a \\ncorresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities. At this time, while livestock \\nproduction, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb and dairy), is a significant \\nsource of emissions in the agriculture sector, it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significant \\nshort-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock \\nmanagement, and because it is not yet clear what appropriate transition pathways are for \\nlivestock production. In the interim, it is appropriate to maximise the significant mitigation potential \\nhere, noting the point made above that the best practices for livestock production do not prevent \\nor close down further opportunities that might deliver greater mitigation opportunities in the \\nsector. However, it is noted that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing \\nbeyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissions \\nintensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption \\npatterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially certain \\nbeef, lamb and dairy products.129 \\n\\nThis implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste, as well as \\nstructural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy efforts will \\nbe required to manage both consumer behavioural changes and to incentivise and manage \\nstructural change in the agri-food supply chain. Future Taxonomy updates should, however, \\nconsider what rates of meat consumption and/or practices for production are compatible with a \\nzero-carbon economy \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  More granular actions can deliver significant mitigation, but not at a sufficient level to be \\n\\nrecognised as making a substantial contribution to climate mitigation at the level of the economic \\nactivity as a whole. They can also be a significant portion of lending portfolios for some investors \\nand so it is essential to develop appropriate criteria for them.  These measures or actions might \\ninclude addressing energy or resource efficiency or land management through: \\n\\no  Subsets of the bundle of management practices described below \\n\\no \\n\\nIrrigation modernisation/ refurbishments (sometimes mitigation, sometimes adaptation) \\n\\no  Upgrades to water pumping and distribution systems  \\n\\no  Use of renewable energy in greenhouses \\n\\no  Replacement/upgrades of agricultural machinery \\n\\no \\n\\nInstallation or upgrade of storage facilities \\n\\no  First processing of agricultural products for the primary market (e.g. relating to olive and \\n\\ngrape processing) to the extent this is included under these NACE codes \\n\\n \\n\\n129 There is consensus in the scientific community that climate neutrality requires dietary shifts, which will also have significant public \\nhealth benefits.  For example, in the EU, energy and protein intake levels are higher than recommended \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for protein by as high as \\n70% per capita compared to WHO guidelines. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  108 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThe Platform is asked to consider how these and any other additional actions which deliver \\nsignificant mitigation might be identified and evaluated, and how these can be incorporated into \\nthe Taxonomy. This includes determining a rule set to define what counts as significant mitigation \\nfrom individual actions, which may be consistent with similar rule sets across other economic \\nactivities, or common across agricultural activities only, or specific to individual agricultural \\nactivities. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nIt is recommended that the Platform also look further into the addressing the complex interactions \\nwithin agricultural production systems between the six environmental goals of the Taxonomy \\npotential maximise synergies and co-benefits across the 6 environmental goals of the Taxonomy. \\nSpecifically: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  The proposed Taxonomy criteria and practices for agriculture have been developed on the basis \\nof enabling systemic change, rather than focusing on individual \\xe2\\x80\\x98fixes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to the mitigation challenge. \\nThe proposed practices consider implications beyond mitigation alone and seek, where possible \\nto support contribution to the wider environmental and climate adaptation objectives of the \\nTaxonomy Regulation. This work should be developed further. The Platform should draw on \\nexisting and emerging evidence to consider further not just how substantial mitigation can be \\npursued without causing significant harm to other objectives, but rather to pursue approaches that \\nfurther optimize synergies and minimize trade-offs between significant contribution to mitigation, \\nadaptation and biodiversity, water, and soil management. This also includes improved \\nconsideration of how the benefits of mixed farming systems can better be captured in the \\nTaxonomy.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f \\n\\nIn addition, livestock production comprises a broad range of practices, including intensive and \\nlandless operations, which can have particular environmental impacts beyond GHG emissions. \\nThere were insufficient resources to analyse the current evidence base in depth in order to allow \\nfor a differentiated treatment of different forms of livestock production from a DNSH angle and it is \\nrecommended that the Platform look into this further.  \\n\\n3.  Regarding expanding the scope of the environmental goals of the Taxonomy:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Although animal welfare and health status and the side-effects of antibiotic use in the livestock \\n\\nsector are currently not part of the DNSH criteria as they do not fall under the environmental \\ngoals prioritised at this time, the stakeholder consultation, as well as available research130 shows \\nthat these are significant societal expectations associated with livestock production131. As such, a \\nrecommendation to the Platform is that criteria addressing animal welfare and health are \\nintegrated at the earliest possible date.  \\n\\n4.  To address challenges around applying and demonstrating compliance with the criteria in the \\n\\ndiversity of agricultural contexts, the Platform is asked to consider the following:  \\n\\n \\n\\n130 E.g. http://www.risefoundation.eu/images/files/2018/2018_RISE_LIVESTOCK_FULL.pdf  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever level of EU livestock \\nproduction, now and in the future, it is essential that continued progress is made on four fronts: improving resource efficiency, \\nreducing leakages into the environment, increasing the health status and welfare of farmed animals, and minimising the use of \\nantibiotics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\n\\n131 Special Eurobarometer 442 on attitudes of Europeans towards animal welfare (2016) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  109 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  What guidance would be necessary to support land managers in implementing the criteria and \\n\\npractices set out in the Taxonomy so as to realise synergies and avoid trade-offs between \\nobjectives. This would lay the ground-work for the Taxonomy as it evolves from DNSH to \\nsubstantial contribution across all environmental objectives. The platform is asked to consider two \\nelements in this regard:  \\n\\no  How and whether it is appropriate to deliver country or regionally tailored advice \\n\\nregarding the applicability of each best practice listed in that localised context. Whilst \\nmost best practices are generic in nature and set out the main approaches to delivering a \\nsubstantial contribution to mitigation in agriculture, the global reach of the Taxonomy \\nnaturally means that some practices in temperate regions may not be as applicable in \\nsub-tropical areas, etc.; \\n\\no  To consider how and what guidance could be provided and by whom, to allow those \\n\\nimplementing the practices for substantial mitigation to do so in a way that benefits other \\nenvironmental objectives and/ or simultaneously ensures no significant harm to other \\nenvironmental objectives. For example, the sowing of catch and cover crops is likely to \\ndeliver significant contribution to water quality objectives by stabilising soils in periods of \\nhigh run-off, preventing silting and the movement of nutrients to water bodies. Advice \\ncould be framed around the location, within a farm, where such practices would deliver \\nparticular benefits to water quality, such as in high nutrient load areas, on slopes, and \\nareas adjacent to water bodies. To assist with this, the TEG has included indictors in the \\nbest practice tables to identify which best practices have potential co-benefits with the \\nother environmental goals of the Taxonomy.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  What can be done to support the development or adoption of tools and methodologies to assist in \\n\\ndemonstrating compliance with these criteria. Specifically: \\n\\no  A large number of carbon audit tools are available at present, although there is variation \\nin the coverage and robustness of these tools. A recent review132 conducted in Scotland \\nidentified three tools deemed technically very suitable for farm-level carbon audits in the \\nScottish context, enabling sufficient robustness, comprehensiveness and clarity of \\ndocumentation: Cool Farm Tool133, Scottish AgRE Calculator134, and JRC Carbon \\ncalculator135.  At least the Cool Farm Tool and JRC Carbon Calculator are also more \\nbroadly applicable in the EU. The FAO-Ex-act tool might also be appropriate to use. It \\nwould be valuable if the Platform could provide guidance on appropriate tools for \\ndemonstrating compliance and support further development of the existing tools to \\naddress capacity building and compliance checking needs associated with a transition to \\nlow-carbon farming. \\n\\n \\n\\n132 Leinonen, I., V.

This includes engaging to align those \\nstandards or certification schemes if needed. The adoption of such proxy indicators \\nwould help substantially in the cost-effective demonstration of compliance with these \\ncriteria and thresholds.   \\n\\no  Likewise, efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the post-2020 CAP \\nfor EU users. This is a work in progress made complicated by the fact that the post-2020 \\nCAP has not been adopted at this time. The Platform is, therefore, requested to review \\nthe provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether any changes \\nwould need to be made to these Criteria based on that.  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  The need or not to flex the criteria for different users in different circumstances. In particular: \\n\\no  As currently proposed, in the main, the Criteria apply equally to, and do not distinguish \\nbetween, smaller and large scale farms.  This seems appropriate in terms of seeking to \\naddress emissions reductions and sequestration in farms of all sizes to maximise \\naggregate impact, recognising that small farms can be some of the most inefficient and \\nemitting, and large firms can be some of the most efficient per unit of output, and vice \\nversa.  However, the Platform is asked to consider whether differences should be made \\nin terms of the requirements to demonstrate compliance, recognising the higher \\ntransaction cost impacts for smaller scale farmers. \\n\\no  As noted above, the TEG are of the view that these criteria and thresholds have global \\n\\napplicability, based on input from TEG members and expert advisers with global \\nexpertise and experience. However, additional global consultation will be needed to \\nconfirm the appropriateness of these proposals for crop and livestock production around \\nthe world.    \\n\\n5.  To keep these criteria up-to-date, the Platform is asked to:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Regularly review this list of practices to integrate new advances in understanding and scientific \\n\\nknowledge and any implications of amendments to the Common Agricultural Policy.  \\n\\n6.  Lastly, as noted above, these criteria focus on the significant mitigation potential that can be realised \\n\\nin the way these crops and resources are produced, regardless of their end use. They do not take \\ninto account any contribution that agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy. \\nThe Platform is asked to consider this aspect further to determine whether and under what \\ncircumstances alternative criteria for (some) agricultural production or producers might be \\nappropriate in light of potential substantial contributions they can enable in downstream economic \\nactivities that are part of the bioeconomy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  111 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.1   Growing of perennial crops \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\nCode \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nMitigation criteria \\n\\nA - Agriculture, forestry and fishing \\n\\n3 \\n\\nA1.2 \\n\\nGrowing of perennial crops \\n\\nPrinciples \\n\\nBoth of the principles set out here must be fulfilled: \\n\\n1.

It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whether \\nfor biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely to ensure high carbon stock land is \\nnot converted for the purposes for agricultural production.   \\n\\n137 Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology of \\npart C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled.   \\n\\n \\n\\n113 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n-  The essential management practices are described in the \\n\\ntable below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, \\nexcept where particular practices can be demonstrated to be \\nnot applicable to that farm holding given the particular \\nbiophysical conditions at that farm holding. \\n\\n- \\n\\nIn respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG \\nassessment, this assessment should be done using tools that \\ncover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with \\nproduction, as well as emissions associated with energy and \\nfuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be \\ndemonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently \\naccessible to farmers in a given location (either because of \\nlanguage or lack of access to farm advisory support), this \\npractice may be omitted in the first instance. The \\nassessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year \\nperiod. The assessment is a self-assessment using an \\nappropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the \\nGHG assessment is required.  \\n\\n-  To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, \\n\\nit will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability \\nmanagement plan which describes the management \\npractices being deployed - taking into account crop \\nhusbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and \\ntheir coverage on the farm.  To prepare the farm \\nsustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be \\nused, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient \\ndecision-support tools.  \\n\\n-  For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds: \\n\\n-  To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG \\n\\nthresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock \\nand GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for \\nrelevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline \\ndata that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be \\nmeasured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also \\nassess where action is needed, and this must be \\naccompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the \\nmanagement practices that will deliver the GHG emissions \\nreduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management \\nplan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan.  \\n\\n-  Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being \\n\\nfinanced is less than 20 years, to show broad compliance \\nwith the requirement for carbon stocks to increase \\nprogressively over a 20 year period, assurance should be \\nsought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the \\npermanence of carbon sequestration trends.  It is recognised \\nthat uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger \\n\\n114 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nstage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration period \\nbetween will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some \\nemissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall \\nmaintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends in \\nsequestration are sought over multiple rotations.  \\n\\n-  For all users: \\n\\n-  Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels \\n\\nshould include the following, though it is recognised that in \\npractice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the \\ntechnical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being \\nused:  \\n\\no  CO2 emissions and removals in above ground \\n\\nbiomass \\n\\no  CO2 emissions and removals in below ground \\n\\nbiomass and soils \\n\\no  N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser \\napplication, and those embedded in fertiliser \\nproduction and fertiliser application \\n\\no  CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation \\n\\nand manure management) and some soils (e.g. \\nwetlands)  \\n\\no  CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use \\n\\n-  Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be \\naudited at 3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance \\nwith these requirements.  \\n\\n- \\n\\nIn the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural \\ndisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the \\nachievement of the thresholds and will not affect the \\napplication of these requirements or result in non-compliance \\nwith these criteria. \\n\\n \\n\\nManagement \\ncategory \\n\\nFarm GHG \\nassessment \\n\\nEssential management practice  \\n\\nGHG \\n\\xef\\x82\\xaf  \\n\\nC-Seq \\n\\xef\\x82\\xad \\n\\nCo-\\nbenefits \\n\\nUndertake a GHG assessment of sources of \\nemissions and sinks on the farm.

The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be \\n\\n117 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nmet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an \\nindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it \\nmay be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would \\nstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises \\nthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and \\nthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms \\nor other sectors.  \\n\\nFurthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switch \\nfrom higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by reducing cattle numbers and \\nincreasing legume production as an alternative source of protein), with a corresponding consumption \\nswitch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus specifically on \\nemissions within the perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of mitigation action.  \\n\\nThe criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantially \\nreduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level. \\n\\nThere is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestration \\nthrough good practices in perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed in \\norder to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a \\nnet zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of perennial cropland management \\nmaximises its contribution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this rationale drove the principles set out above.  \\n\\n \\n\\nApproach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity \\n\\nThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ \\nha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such \\ninformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation \\nwould remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice.  \\n\\nHowever, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e) is possible, where these can be \\nmade relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative \\nmeans of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into \\naccount emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already \\ndelivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to \\ndeliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively \\npoorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm \\nlevel is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and \\napproaches.  \\n\\nThe proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment \\nof specific bundles of management practices, that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon \\nproduction in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are \\nexisting mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable \\napproach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this \\napproach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will \\nadditional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets \\n\\n118 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nand equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint. As such, it avoids the \\nproblems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above.  \\n\\nEmission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric \\nfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and \\nmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore \\npredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture \\nemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only \\n0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agricultural non-\\nCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous \\noxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and \\nexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely \\nfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, \\ncooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed \\nbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than \\n20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source \\nrequirements.  \\n\\nIn respect of perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated with \\nsoil management and the application of fertilisers, and emissions embedded in post-harvest waste.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMetrics and thresholds for this economic activity \\n\\nOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigation  \\n\\nRationale  for  the  selection  of  practices:  Scientific  literature  identifies  a  wide  range  of  possible \\nmitigation  practices  available  in  the  agricultural  sector  to  address  the  different  emissions  and \\nopportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management.   \\n\\nFor  the  purpose  of  establishing  criteria  and  thresholds  which  identify  when  the  economic  activity  of \\nperennial cropland  delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for \\nwhich: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge  and consensus on the  mitigation effects  and \\ninteractions  with  other  environmental  and  food  security  objectives;  and  2)  the  scale,  certainty  and \\nconsistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008140, Paustian \\net al. 2016141, Kay et al. 2019142).   \\n\\nThese management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as \\nto secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production \\xe2\\x80\\x93 outcomes critical \\nfor the delivery of substantial mitigation - and/ or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also do \\nnot risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislation \\n\\n \\n\\n140 Smith, P. et al.

These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of \\nbiophysical and farming conditions. \\n\\nScientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also \\nindicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial \\nmitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally \\nsustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidance \\non  how  to  translate  sectoral  or  activity-based  mitigation  potential  into  individual  farm-level  mitigation \\npotential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in \\ndifferent conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determine \\nthe  minimum  combination  of  practices  which  should  be  applied  together  for  perennial  cropland \\nmanagement to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.   \\n\\nThe table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, \\ndeployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that given \\nheterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions \\nimpacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial \\nmitigation in the majority of cases.  The applicable area for management practices relates to where \\nthose practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, \\nbuffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and \\nditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they \\nadd value.  \\n\\nOne best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced \\nemissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness of \\nwhere  the  main  emission  sources  are  on  a  farm  holding,  what  opportunities  exist  to  reduce  those \\nemissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities \\nfor carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or \\naudit  of  the  assessment  is  required  to  fulfil  this  best  practice  requirement.  This  is  different  from  the \\nquantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when  demonstrating \\ncompliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessment should be done using tools that cover \\nall  relevant  emissions  on  the  farm  associated  with  crop,  livestock  production,  as  well  as  emissions \\nassociated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently \\naccessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory \\nsupport),  this  practice  may  be  omitted  in  the  first  instance.  The  assessment,  however,  becomes \\nmandatory within a five year period,   \\n\\n \\n\\nOn GHG emission reduction thresholds \\n\\nSubstantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -\\nnegative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to \\nvarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions \\nfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which \\nemission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is \\nalso noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 should be \\nconsistent in the global context.  \\n\\n120 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nA review by Wollenberg et al, 2016143 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between \\n0.9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 \\xc2\\xb0C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an \\napproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are \\xe2\\x80\\x9can annualized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, not \\ncumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15\\xe2\\x80\\x937.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for \\nagriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11\\xe2\\x80\\x9318% reduction relative to the scenarios\\xe2\\x80\\x99 respective \\n2030 business as usual baselines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d144. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly do \\nnot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. \\nAs such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has \\nbeen proposed as \\xe2\\x80\\x98significant contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work \\nfrom Frank et al (2018)145, and The IPCC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007)146. \\n\\nIn terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al \\n(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to \\n2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, \\nrelative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure \\nneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move \\ntowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for \\nany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger \\n(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear \\nbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by \\n2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies \\nimplementation and communication. \\n\\nThe study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However, \\nestablishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation \\neffectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was \\nnot in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare \\nemissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 years-time and assess this against the target \\nreduction.  \\n\\nThe threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as \\ngCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions \\nintensity (e.g. through energy or resource efficiency) while also requiring them to reduce emissions \\noverall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the overall goal. \\n\\n \\n\\n143 Wollenberg, E., Richards, M., Smith, P., Havli\\xcc\\x81k, P., Obersteiner, M., Tubiello, F.

Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in \\nline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions \\n(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is \\nimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific \\narea.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly \\ncontext specific.  \\n\\nFurthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting \\nthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of \\nemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction over 10 years for example can be expected to \\ndeliver a \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission \\nreductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural \\nland as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock \\nincrease would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2\\xc2\\xb0C climate stabilisation target scenario, as \\nthis is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or \\nthe level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, \\nrecognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture \\nsector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU \\nwith a prevailing intensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical \\npotential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in \\nreducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland \\nmanagement, grazing land management, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of \\ndegraded lands.  \\n\\nThe proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing \\ncarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 year \\nperiod for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation \\nperiod. Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, \\nassurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon \\nsequestration trends.  It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage \\ncrops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and \\nsome emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks \\nand/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations.  \\n\\nOn no conversion of high carbon stock land \\n\\nA cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the \\noperation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This \\nprovides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated \\nfor this criterion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n122 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nOn demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds \\n\\n3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being \\ndelivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking \\nis required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.  \\n\\nTo prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can \\nalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.

It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whether \\nfor biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely, to ensure high carbon stock land is \\nnot converted for the purposes for agricultural production.   \\n\\n157 Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology of \\npart C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled.   \\n\\n \\n\\n127 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\npractices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding \\ngiven the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding. \\n\\n- \\n\\nIn respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, \\nthis assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant \\nemissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions \\nassociated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG \\ncategories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool \\nis currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of \\nlanguage or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may \\nbe omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes \\nmandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-\\nassessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or \\nverification of the GHG assessment is required.  \\n\\n-  To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be \\n\\nnecessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which \\ndescribes the management practices being deployed - taking into \\naccount crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - \\nand their coverage on the farm.  To prepare the farm sustainability \\nmanagement plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can \\nalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.  \\n\\n-  For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds: \\n\\n-  To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will \\nbe necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline \\nfor the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against \\nsuch baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can \\nbe measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess \\nwhere action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon \\nmanagement plan to set out the management practices that will deliver \\nthe GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon \\nmanagement plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan.  \\n\\n-  Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is \\nless than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement for \\ncarbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period, \\nassurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote \\nthe permanence of carbon sequestration trends.  It is recognised that \\nuprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with a \\npotential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in \\ncarbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective is \\nto ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends \\nin sequestration are sought over multiple rotations.  \\n\\n-  For all users: \\n\\n-  Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should \\n\\ninclude the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope \\nof GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG \\naccounting tools being used:  \\n\\n128 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\no  CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass \\n\\no  CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass and \\n\\nsoils \\n\\no  N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, and \\n\\nthose embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliser application \\n\\no  CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation and \\n\\nmanure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands)  \\n\\no  CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use \\n\\n-  Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at 3-\\nyear intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with these requirements.  \\n\\n- \\n\\nIn the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural \\ndisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the \\nthresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or \\nresult in non-compliance with these criteria. \\n\\n \\n\\nEssential management practice  \\n\\nGHG \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xaf \\n\\nC-\\nSeq \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xad \\n\\nCo-\\n\\nbenefits \\n\\nUndertake a GHG assessment of sources of \\nemissions and sinks on the farm.

The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be \\nmet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an \\nindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it \\n\\n131 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nmay be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would \\nstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises \\nthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and \\nthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms \\nor other sectors. Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a \\nwhole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by moving \\nfrom conventional production using artificial fertiliser to organic farming), with a corresponding \\nconsumption switch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus \\nspecifically on emissions within the non-perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of \\nmitigation potential.  \\n\\nThe criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantially \\nreduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level. \\n\\nThere is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestration \\nthrough good practices in non-perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed \\nin order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a \\nnet-zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of non-perennial cropland management \\nmaximises its contribution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this rationale drove the principles set out above.  \\n\\n \\n\\nApproach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity \\n\\nThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ \\nha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such \\ninformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation, \\nwould remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation.  \\n\\nHowever, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of \\nproduction) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or \\nproject. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a \\nrelatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might \\npreviously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it \\nis harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in \\nemissions than it is for a farm that currently performs relatively poorly.  Furthermore, to determine \\ncompliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at the farm level is necessary. However, this \\nis not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches.  \\n\\nThe proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment \\nof specific bundles of management practices, which are recognised as essential to delivering low \\ncarbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and \\nthere are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly \\ncommunicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the \\nground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well \\nas those that will require additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of \\nfarms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG \\n\\n132 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nfootprint. As such, this approach avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as \\ndescribed above.  \\n\\nEmission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric \\nfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and \\nmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore \\npredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture \\nemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only \\n0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agricultural non-\\nCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous \\noxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and \\nexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely \\nfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, \\ncooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed \\nbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than \\n20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source \\nrequirements.   \\n\\nIn respect of non-perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated \\nwith soil management and the application of fertilisers, methane emissions from rice cultivation, and \\navoided emissions embedded in crop waste.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMetrics and thresholds for this economic activity \\n\\nOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigation  \\n\\nRationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible \\nmanagement practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and \\nopportunities for sequestration in non-perennial cropland management.  For the purpose of \\nestablishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of non-perennial cropland \\ndelivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is \\nsufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with \\nother environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of \\nmitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008160, Paustian et al. 2016161, \\nKay et al. 2019162).   \\n\\nThese management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so \\nas to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production \\xe2\\x80\\x93 outcomes \\ncritical for the delivery of substantial mitigation.  The selected practices include reducing the carbon \\nintensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary \\n\\n \\n\\n160 Smith, P. et al.

These practices deliver substantial mitigation with \\nrelatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions. \\n\\nScientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and \\nalso indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to \\nsubstantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are \\nenvironmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, \\nprovides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into \\nindividual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e. what combination of practices should be applied together \\nas a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG \\nexpert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied \\ntogether for non-perennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.   \\n\\nThe table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, \\ndeployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that given \\nheterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions \\nimpacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial \\nmitigation in the majority of cases.   \\n\\nThe applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be \\ndeployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soil \\nerosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practices \\nmay only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value.  \\n\\nOne best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced \\nemissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness of \\nwhere the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist and thus where greatest \\nmitigation  impact  could  be  achieved,  including  through  opportunities  for  carbon  sinks,  and  thereby \\nimprove  the  targeting  of  mitigation  action.  In  this  spirit,  no  verification  or  audit  of  the  assessment  is \\nrequired. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are \\nnecessary  when  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  quantitative  GHG  thresholds.  The  assessment \\nshould be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestock \\nproduction, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no \\ncarbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language \\nor  lack  of  access  to  farm  advisory  support),  this  practice  may  be  omitted  in  the  first  instance.  The \\nassessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,   \\n\\n \\n\\nOn GHG emission reduction thresholds \\n\\nSubstantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -\\nnegative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to \\nvarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions \\nfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically, the degree to \\nwhich emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. \\nIt is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 should be \\nconsistent in the global context.  \\n\\n134 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nA review by Wollenberg et al, 2016163 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between \\n0.9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 \\xc2\\xb0C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an \\napproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are \\xe2\\x80\\x9can annualized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, not \\ncumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15\\xe2\\x80\\x937.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for \\nagriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11\\xe2\\x80\\x9318% reduction relative to the scenarios\\xe2\\x80\\x99 respective \\n2030 business as usual baselines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d164. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly do \\nnot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. \\nAs such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has \\nbeen proposed as \\xe2\\x80\\x98significant contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work \\nfrom Frank et al (2018)165, and The IPCC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007)166. \\n\\nIn terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al \\n(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to \\n2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, \\nrelative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure \\nneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move \\ntowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for \\nany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger \\n(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear \\nbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by \\n2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies \\nimplementation and communication.  \\n\\nThe study determined these reductions against a business as usual (BaU) scenario for agriculture. \\nHowever, establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit \\nimplementation effectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the \\nmitigation action was not in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the \\nrequirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved over the period and \\nassess this against the target reduction for that period.  \\n\\nThe threshold metric is gCO2e, and not an intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of production, as this \\nenables the Taxonomy to be applied by both those reducing emission intensity (e.g. through efficiency) \\nwhile also requiring them to reduce emissions overall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the overall goal.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn setting Carbon stock thresholds \\n\\n \\n\\n163 Wollenberg, E., Richards, M., Smith, P., Havli\\xcc\\x81k, P., Obersteiner, M., Tubiello, F.

Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in \\nline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions \\n(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is \\nimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific \\narea.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly \\ncontext specific.  \\n\\nFurthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting \\nthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of \\nemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\ncontribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the \\npremise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively \\nlittle evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on \\nagricultural land in a 1.5 or 2\\xc2\\xb0C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of \\nemissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon \\nsequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C \\nsequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global \\nscale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing \\nintensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emission \\nreductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2 \\nemissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing land \\nmanagement, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands.  \\n\\nThe proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing \\ncarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 year \\nperiod for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation \\nperiod. Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, \\nassurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon \\nsequestration trends.  It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage \\ncrops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and \\nsome emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks \\nand/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn no conversion of high carbon stock land \\n\\nA cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the \\noperation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This \\nprovides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated \\nfor this criterion. \\n\\n \\n\\nOn demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds \\n\\n136 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being \\ndelivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking \\nis required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.  \\n\\nTo prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can \\nalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.

If it can be demonstrated that no carbon \\nassessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location \\n(either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory \\nsupport), this practice may be omitted in the first instance.

The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be \\nmet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an \\nindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it \\nmay be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would \\nstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises \\nthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and \\n\\n177 Consistent with GAEC 1 of Annex III of COM(2018)392 \\n\\n \\n\\n178 In the EU, this should be interpreted as Member States granting an exemption in line with GAEC 3 of Annex III of COM(2018)392 \\n\\n \\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms \\nor other sectors.  \\n\\nThe criteria proposed in the Taxonomy do not attempt to address this question directly and instead \\nfocus on ensuring that emissions are reduced and that removals increase at the economic activity \\n(NACE code) level. \\n\\nWhile livestock production, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb, dairy), is a \\nsignificant source of emissions in the agriculture sector it is included in the Taxonomy due to the \\nsignificant short-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock \\nmanagement, and in particular long-lived greenhouse gases (N20, CO2), through good practices on \\nthe farm. In the short term, emission reductions associated with improved nitrogen use efficiency and \\nmanure management are substantial, with overall positive impacts on farm level economics. Each of \\nthese needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial \\nmitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy. Doing so ensures each instance of \\nlivestock management maximises its contribution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this rationale drove the principles set out above.  \\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing \\nbeyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissions \\nintensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption \\npatterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially beef, lamb and \\ndairy products. This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste, \\nas well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy efforts \\nwill be required to manage both behavioural changes on the side of consumers and to incentivise and \\nmanage structural change in the agri-food supply chain At this point, the Taxonomy cannot address \\nsuch shifts, but can only point to significant short-term potential associated with efficiency gains. Future \\nTaxonomy updates should, however, consider these aspects.  \\n\\n \\n\\nApproach taken to setting thresholds for livestock production \\n\\nThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ \\nha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such \\ninformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds would remain \\nchallenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation.  \\n\\nHowever, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of \\nproduction) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or \\nproject. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a \\nrelatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might \\npreviously have been achieved and farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, is \\nharder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in \\nemissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine \\ncompliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. But this is not yet \\nmainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n147 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThe proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment \\nof specific bundles of management practices, practices that are recognised as essential to delivering \\nlow carbon production in different types of agriculture. This qualitative approach is relatively simple to \\nmonitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more \\ndirectly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on \\nthe ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as \\nwell as those that will additional investment finance to do so,  it also allows for the recognition of farms \\n(and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint, so \\navoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above.  \\n\\nEmission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric \\nfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and \\nmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e). And they are predominantly from reductions in non-CO2 \\nemissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy \\nuse being a minor component (covering only 0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). \\nThe largest share of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent \\nnitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from \\nagriculture (largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with \\nmethane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely from livestock and rice cultivation).  In some cases, \\nGHG emission from energy (traction, heating, cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of \\nemissions arising from the farm.  The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when \\nGHG emissions from energy are greater than 20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% \\nthrough efficiency and energy source requirements. \\n\\nIn relation to livestock management, mitigation potential derives from improved animal health planning, \\nlower-emission feeding strategies, and reducing emissions from manure management and waste \\ntreatment (Buckley et al. 2015179, Chadwick et al 2011180, Miselbrook et al 2014181).  \\n\\n \\n\\nMetrics and thresholds \\n\\nOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigation  \\n\\nRationale  for  the  selection  of  practices:  Scientific  literature  identifies  a  wide  range  of  possible \\nmitigation activities available in livestock production to address the different emissions and opportunities \\nfor sequestration.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n179 Buckley, C., Howley, P. and Jordan, P.

These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of \\nbiophysical and farming conditions.  \\n\\nScientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories or individual practices and \\nalso indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to \\nsubstantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are \\nenvironmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, \\nprovides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into \\nindividual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together \\nas a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG \\nexpert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied \\ntogether for each NACE activity code to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.   \\n\\nThe table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that, \\ndeployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation from livestock production at farm level. It is \\nnoted that given heterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in \\ndifferent emissions impacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will \\ndeliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases.   \\n\\nThe applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be \\ndeployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soil \\nerosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practices \\nmay only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value.  \\n\\nOne best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced \\nemissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness of \\nwhere the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist and thus where \\ngreatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, and \\nthereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of the \\nassessment is required. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, \\nboth of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. \\nThe assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated \\n\\n \\n\\n182 Smith, P. et al.

This was selected as an \\napproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are \\xe2\\x80\\x9can annualized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, not \\ncumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15\\xe2\\x80\\x937.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for \\nagriculture in 2030.

As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions they implicitly do \\nnot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. \\nAs such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has \\nbeen proposed as \\xe2\\x80\\x98significant contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the context of the Taxonomy.

However, \\nestablishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation \\neffectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was \\nnot in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare \\nemissions at the start of period with those achieved over the specified period and assess this against \\nthe target reduction.  \\n\\nThe threshold metric is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of \\nproduction, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity (e.g. \\nthrough efficiency improvements) while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the overall \\ngoal.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn setting Carbon stock thresholds \\n\\nSetting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viable \\noption given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which is very context \\nspecific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in \\nline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions \\n(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is \\nimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific \\narea.  Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly \\ncontext specific.  \\n\\nFurthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting \\nthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of \\nemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\ncontribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the \\npremise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively \\nlittle evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on \\nagricultural land in a 1.5 or 2\\xc2\\xb0C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of \\nemissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon \\nsequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C \\nsequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global \\nscale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing \\nintensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emission \\nreductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2 \\nemissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing land \\nmanagement, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n151 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nThe proposal therefore is to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing \\ncarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks (confirmed at 3-year intervals) \\nover a 20 year period.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn no conversion of high carbon stock land \\n\\nA cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the \\noperation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This \\nprovides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated \\nfor this criterion. \\n\\n \\n\\nOn demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds \\n\\n3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being \\ndelivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking \\nis required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.  \\n\\nTo prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can \\nalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.

In practice the \\nthreshold of 170kg/ha/year has been implemented by Member States by setting limits on livestock density between 1.7 - 2.0 \\nlivestock units / ha.

MANUFACTURING \\n\\nWhy manufacturing is included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nManufacturing is the second largest contributor to CO2e emissions but is also be able to produce the \\nproducts and technologies that can contribute to GHG emissions reductions in other sectors of the \\neconomy and is thus a fundamental part of the low-carbon economy. \\n\\nThe manufacturing section of the Taxonomy therefore includes both the manufacturing of low-carbon \\ntechnologies as well as energy intensive and hard-to-abate manufacturing sectors. It aims to give support \\nto those economic activities that are low in carbon emissions and first movers who are engaging in a \\ntransformational shift.  \\n\\nManufacturing coverage and thresholds \\n\\nWhich economic activities are included and why \\n\\nThe economic activities covered include sectors that account for a high share of industrial GHG emissions \\nas a result of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to the manufacture of the products and therefore \\noffer large potential for GHG emissions reduction. Specifically, this includes: the manufacturing of \\naluminium (NACE 24.42); the manufacturing of iron and steel (NACE 24.1, 24.2, 24.3); the manufacturing \\nof cement (NACE 23.51); and the manufacturing of chemicals (NACE 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, 20.16).  \\n\\nAdditionally, enabling activities are also included in manufacturing which covers both those activities \\nincluded under \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow carbon technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and also \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmitigation measures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which when combined result in \\nachievement of the thresholds.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Low carbon activities  refers to: the manufacturing of products, key components, equipment and \\n\\nmachinery that are essential to a number of key renewable energy technologies (geothermal power, \\nhydropower, concentrated solar power (CSP), solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, wind energy and \\nocean energy); the manufacturing of low-carbon transport vehicles, fleets and vessels; the \\nmanufacturing of energy efficiency equipment for buildings and other low-carbon technologies that \\nresult in substantial GHG emission reductions in further sectors of the economy (including private \\nhouseholds).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Mitigation measures are included as enabling activities since they are recognised as critical steps \\nsupporting the transition of economic activities in these high emitting manufacturing sectors towards \\nreaching the defined thresholds.  \\n\\nThe TEG acknowledges that many manufacturing activities are still not currently covered in the \\nTaxonomy, and this must be addressed. It should be stated, however, that the TEG have not assumed \\nthat omitted activities are non-green or brown. Due to limited time, the TEG has focused its attention on \\nthose economic activities likely to play the biggest role in leading Europe down a low-carbon pathway to \\nmeet its Paris Agreement and 2050 climate neutrality goals. Therefore, the first round of sectors included \\nin the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy are either those energy intensive and hard-to-abate sectors \\nthat emit the most greenhouse gas emissions or those enabling manufacturing sectors that are clearly \\nnecessary for Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low-carbon economic transformation. This means that other manufacturing \\nsectors (including other energy-intensive sectors) are not currently included even if they are significant in \\ntheir impact.  \\n\\n \\n\\n155 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nCriteria, Metrics and Thresholds \\n\\nThe manufacturing activities addressed in this first draft of the mitigation Taxonomy are considered to \\nmake a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if the specific thresholds set for each activity \\nare reached (e.g. producing cement with GHG emissions lower than 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement. The criteria \\nfocus instead on reducing the GHG emissions caused by manufacturing activities up to the levels of \\nperformance achieved by best performers. The criteria cover in general both scope 1 and 2 emissions. \\nAdditionally, in a number of sectors, the requirement to limit GHG emissions to the level set in the EU \\nETS benchmarks has been complemented by other thresholds (e.g. on the energy efficiency and carbon \\nintensity of the electricity used) or by alternative qualitative criteria (e.g. making production of recycled \\naluminium eligible).   \\n\\nThe EU ETS benchmarks have been the main reference for setting such thresholds, as they correspond \\nto the level of performance achieved by the 10% best installations in the EU and are updated regularly. \\nThe platform is recommended to review whether additional requirements could be set for those economic \\nactivities where BAT-Associated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist or are developed over time, \\nbased on such levels. The implications of this in terms of global applicability of the Taxonomy will need to \\nbe considered. A regular update is also is needed to assess if alternative low carbon technologies have \\nbecome market ready and commercially available. This may result in alternative threshold criteria for \\nactivities that currently have a threshold based on EU ETS benchmarks. \\n\\n The thresholds for the manufacturing activities are predominantly tied to EU ETS benchmarks. That \\nmeans that the thresholds reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a \\nparticular sector. EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they are the most robust \\nbenchmarks available and the data calculated according to the boundaries set are readily available for all \\ninstallations within the EU that are part of the EU ETS scheme. Although performance data using such \\nmetrics are not necessarily readily available for non-EU installations, the methodologies can be followed \\nand therefore can also be calculated univocally for non-EU installations. Additionally, the EU ETS \\nbenchmarks are periodically updated approximately every 5 years, meaning that the thresholds that refer \\nto them will not be static over time but automatically continue to represent the performance of the 10% \\nbest performing plants. \\n\\nThe TEG recognizes that there are disadvantages to using the EU ETS benchmarks. The benchmarks \\nare based on EU historic trends rather than global data. Moreover, EU ETS benchmarks do not consider \\nthe full lifecycle of a process or product but are focused on scope 1 and/or scope 2 GHG emissions. \\nTherefore, EU ETS benchmarks do not directly support recycling or improvement in upstream emissions. \\nMindful of these limitations the TEG has actively looked for equally robust data sources but has to date \\nnot been able to identify equally robust data sources. Where equally robust data can be provided \\nthese should be considered by the Platform.  \\n\\nThere are no explicit thresholds for those manufacturing activities listed under the category \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow carbon \\ntechnologies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  No criteria on the GHG emissions from manufacturing of listed products are specified \\nsince the mitigation benefits of these products, components, equipment and technology are considered to \\noutweigh the emissions generated as a result of the manufacturing process to generate them. This \\nuncomprehensive list is complemented by additional criteria that allow additional products, components, \\nequipment or technologies to be considered eligible if the overall benefits in terms of GHG emissions \\n\\n \\n\\n156 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nreductions are proven by life cycle carbon foot printing. (See low carbon technologies section in tables \\nbelow). \\n\\nMitigation measures are eligible for inclusion under manufacturing when expenditures in energy \\nefficiency measures, process improvements and all other mitigation measures in one of the eligible \\nmanufacturing activities support closing the gap between the current level of efficiency and the level \\nconsidered \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantially contributing to mitigation objectives\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as defined by the thresholds. This has two \\nimplications for users of the Taxonomy:  \\n\\ni. \\n\\nii. \\n\\nFor private finance users of the Taxonomy, where revenues from Taxonomy eligible activities \\ncount, such as equities (the share of a corporation would be considered eligible based on the \\nshare of revenues from Taxonomy-eligible activities): only manufacturing activities complying with \\nthe activity threshold would be considered eligible. \\n\\nFor the uses of the Taxonomy where expenditures in Taxonomy-eligible measures count (such as \\nfor financing projects, green mortgages, the use of proceeds from green bonds or simply counting \\nhow much a corporation has invested in climate mitigation): all the investments needed to reach \\nthe activity threshold would be considered eligible. This means that measures are eligible once \\nthey are implemented entirely and the threshold is reached, as well as if individual investments in \\ndifferent measures are implemented over a defined time span as part of an overall investment \\nplan (e.g. 5 or 10 years) and substantially support the activity achieving the thresholds. \\n\\nApplication of CCS in the Manufacturing Sector  \\n\\nIn the manufacturing sector, certain processes are difficult to reduce to very low carbon levels, particularly \\nin the metals, minerals and chemical sectors. In those cases, switching to renewable energy sources and \\nenergy efficient measures are not feasible options and very low carbon levels may only be achieved by \\neither implementing an alternative manufacturing process, like switching to the production of alternative \\nproducts, or due to the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which are \\naddressed in another section of the Taxonomy. Additionally, if CCS enables an economic activity in the \\nmanufacturing sector to meet its screening criteria, the installation of CCS technology can be considered \\nTaxonomy eligible once the screening criteria has been met. This also applies to overall economic \\nactivity. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), where the captured CO2 is utilized as a feed stock (e.g. for \\na chemical process), may also qualify, if substantial mitigation impacts can be demonstrated by reducing \\nemissions towards meeting the activity criteria (e.g. the use of CO2 for enhanced oil extraction would not \\nqualify). \\n\\nCoherence with other sections of the Taxonomy \\n\\nDue to the nature of manufacturing, and in order to undertake a proper systemic value chain approach in \\nthe Taxonomy, close linkages have been made with the energy, transport, agriculture and building \\nsectors. Where possible, circularity considerations (in so far as they affect GHG emissions) and a broader \\nvalue chain approach have been considered. Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains, \\nthe future Platform will need to review the thresholds to assess whether changes will be necessary to \\naccommodate the planned circular economy objectives of the Taxonomy. i.e.it is recommended that at \\nthe point in time when the Platform work to define threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular \\neconomy contributions the manufacturing thresholds currently defined with regard to mitigation and \\nadaptation objectives are reviewed.  \\n\\n \\n\\n157 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nStakeholder feedback  \\n\\nIn June 2019 the TEG published its report on EU Taxonomy.196 The manufacturing group were very \\npleased to receive the rich and insightful comments which have inform the TEG. It should be noted that \\nsome sectors submitted their comments collectively through an industry representative where as others \\nsubmitted similar or identical text multiple times. What follows is an overview of how the TEG subgroup \\nhas worked to respond to the Call for Feedback to get feedback on the publications.  \\n\\n1. The most contentious aspect in manufacturing in terms of the highest number of disagreements was in \\nrelation to the list of low carbon technologies list. Most of the submissions, many of them identical, were \\nrequesting additional technologies to be included in the list. These were reviewed and appropriate \\namendments were made to the list in the light of these comments.  \\n\\n2. Stakeholder expressed concerns about the stringency of the thresholds for the manufacture of \\nhydrogen given the need for green hydrogen to contribute to a 2050 zero future. As a result of feedback, \\nthe thresholds were amended.  \\n\\n3. There were multiple requests for a life-cycle analysis of steel to be taken into account in thresholds \\nproposed to acknowledge that steel is a material that can fully be recycled and will continue to play a role \\nin a low carbon economy. We acknowledge the role that steel may play in the supply chain efficiencies, \\nbut for practical reasons have limited the scope of  thresholds proposed to the production of primary steel \\nand steel recycling only. At this stage, circular economy criteria for steel are not proposed and need to be \\ndeveloped in a later stage. In this respect, the manufacturing of e.g. aluminium or cement is dealt with in \\na similar way. \\n\\n4. It was noted that there many of the submission relating to different manufacturing activities, including \\ncement were not purely of  technical nature but were rather presented as  a position. The TEG has \\nworked to ensure that the thresholds applied  promote low carbon production.  \\n\\n5. There was some considerable concern from stakeholders about the manufacture of plastics, \\nparticularly single source plastic production. Many of the submissions recommended a circular economic \\nperspective be introduced. In response, the threshold has become more explicit in limiting eligibility to \\nthose plastic manufactures where at least 90% of the final plastic is not used for single use consumer \\nproducts and is not recycled. This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from science-based \\nresearch/studies etc.  \\n\\n \\n\\nNext steps and recommendations  \\n\\n1. The TEG recognizes that the scope of the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy should be extended \\nto cover more manufacturing activities. Care must continue to be taken to review the context in which the \\nTaxonomy is applied to ensure that it does not identify activities as green which have perverse incentives \\nor a negative impact on other environmental objectives. From a manufacturing perspective, the TEG \\n\\n196 See, https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy_en.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n158 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nrecommends that in the next round the future platform consider building on the work undertaken to \\nestablish thresholds for other manufacturing sectors that include at least in the near-term: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Further analysis of high polluting activities such as glass manufacturing, paper and pulp \\n\\nmanufacturing, and textiles. The manufacturing processes for these activities are complex, multiple \\nand result in the production of an array of diverse products. The TEG recommends that the future \\nplatform address these manufacturing sectors, by prioritising those processes that contribute the \\nmost significant portion of emissions (e.g. steam generation in the paper and pulp sector) and work to \\nestablish thresholds for these specific processes.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Mining: this is an important sector both in terms of avoiding bottlenecks in the deployment of low-\\n\\ncarbon technologies by providing the critical materials needed for low-carbon technologies, as well as \\nthe value chain link with energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. Unfortunately, the TEG was not able \\nto complete work for this sector due to time constraints and the complexity of the issues The TEG \\nrecommends that the platform analyse the role the sector plays in terms of enhancing availability of \\nthe critical materials needed for current and future technologies to create a climate neutral, circular \\nand resource efficient economy, while sourcing raw materials in a sustainable and responsible way, \\nwith a view to consider the enabling potential of the sector. The platform is recommended to ensure \\nthat  a life cycle approach is applied when assessing the different phases of the value chain  for \\nmining is applied. The rational for applying life cycle analysis is that many metals are essential for \\nlow-carbon technologies. For example, Aluminium for lightweight cars; Copper for electrics and \\nmotors in electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines; Battery metals (Cobalt, Lead, Lithium, \\nManganese, and Nickel) for clean mobility and grid storage batteries; Zinc and Cobalt for protecting \\noff-shore wind turbines; Silicon in solar panels; Precious metals for clean mobility and solar panels.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Further analysis for light manufacturing sectors may also need to be considered by the platform \\nas these sectors grow in impact. For these, the platform could either try to develop individual activity \\ncriteria for each (where feasible) or identify key improvement measures applicable across a number \\nof these sectors and classify them as individual enabling activities. \\n\\n2. Further criteria under DNSH could be analysed particular in regard to the following issues:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Red Mud: A waste by product of the process for producing al oxide from the bauxite ore for \\n\\naluminium, referred to as red mud contains toxic heavy metals and its high alkalinity makes it \\ncorrosive and damaging to soil and life forms, presenting potentially substantial impacts  when \\ndisposed. Toxic dumps and settling pools are a feature alongside all bauxite/alumina plants \\nworldwide, including across Europe, Russia, China, Guinea, Brazil, Jamaica and Australia. The global \\naverage of bauxite residue generated per tonne of alumina is between 1 and 1.5 tonnes; it is \\nestimated that over 150 million tonnes of bauxite residue are produced annually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5-6 million tonnes \\nin Europe alone, and the majority of this waste is being landfilled. The platform is recommended to \\nconsider the impacts of red mud under minimum social and health safeguards and develop an \\napproach to set up criteria to integrate this within the DNSH environmental impact. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The platform is recommended to carry out a risk-based assessment on the exposure scenarios \\n\\nfor all chemicals/products/by-products contained in the taxonomy.  It is to be noted that other \\norganic and inorganic chemicals/products/by-products included in the taxonomy are also potentially \\nhazardous to human health and the environment depending upon the exposure scenarios, and \\ntherefore  objective, scientifically robust,  risk-based assessments should be carried out for all. \\n\\n \\n\\n159 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nFurthermore, the platform should take into consideration the value chain and circular economy \\naspects of chemicals/products/by-products.  For example, Chlorine and PVC are required for the \\nproduction of PVC doors and windows, which are necessary for improved energy efficiency of the \\nbuilding sector.  Such value chain and CE considerations would follow a similar logic applied to soda-\\nash in the current version of the Taxonomy, on the basis that it is required for glazing of double and \\ntriple glazed windows. \\n\\n3. The platform is recommended to regularly update the thresholds paying particular attention to: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Ensuring that the thresholds are updated in the light of EU ETS benchmark revisions.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Review the thresholds in the light of circular economy objectives and takes into consideration the \\n\\nimpact of applying an additional requirement that for those economic activities where  BAT-\\nAssociated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist, these must also be met. The implications of \\nthis in terms of global application of the Taxonomy will need to be considered. \\n\\n4. Explore expansion of low carbon technologies list.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Further analysis on the inclusion of factories or companies that produce the following technologies. \\n\\nFor example, heat pumps, LED lighting, Hot water fittings (e.g. taps, showers) that are rated in the top \\nclass (dark green) of the European Water Label Scheme (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/ )  may \\nbe produced by a factory or company but other things may also be produced.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The TEG recommends that in future the platform consider: \\n\\no  manufacturing of charging points for electric vehicles. \\n\\no  How and under what conditions to include carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) \\n\\ntechnologies in different manufacturing sectors, as well as the manufacturing of such \\nequipment.  \\n\\n5. Enhance existing thresholds to account for different applications of cement.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The platform is recommended to consider developing specific thresholds for different applications of \\n\\ncement, e.g. concrete for specific building applications.  The focus should be on the substitution of \\nclinker by binders with a lower content of embedded CO2. Cement is currently produced in many \\ndifferent qualities, which are sometimes used in different applications. As a result exchange between \\ntwo qualities is not always possible. Therefore, on the way to a climate-neutral economy, it has to be \\ndetermined which types of cement in which application areas can be replaced by those with a \\nreduced clinker content, taking into account the availability of clinker substitutes. Within the \\ndecarbonisation of other industries, it may be possible that material flows used today (e.g. fly ash) will \\nno longer be available in the future as a clinker substitute, while the suitability of other materials has \\nnot yet been proven.  The cement types, which are absolutely necessary in a climate-neutral \\neconomy and cannot be replaced, must be produced in a climate-friendly way. For these types, it \\nthen should be examined to what extent the clinker ratio can be lowered, how energy efficiency can \\nbe increased, how electricity from renewable energies can be used, etc.  \\n\\n6. Consider how to enhance circular economy objectives for the sector.  \\n\\n \\n\\n160 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The mitigation thresholds proposed in the taxonomy for manufacturing specifically address the \\nsegment in the supply chain with the highest direct emissions (i.e. the scope 1 and 2 emissions \\nrelated to the manufacturing of the product).  Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply \\nchains, circular economy objectives are of particular relevance for this sector. Once threshold criteria \\nfor meeting substantial circular economy contributions are being developed, we recommend \\nreviewing these in the context of the mitigation threshold criteria, which address a specific segment of \\nthe circular economy. For example, improving LCA within the manufacturing sector. For example, \\nLCA consideration of products (steel/aluminium/cement). \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  With regard to both data availability and value chain depth, it is recommended that further care be \\n\\ntaken by the platform to address two issues: first, the possibility of looking at data complementary to \\nthe ETS benchmarks; and secondly to ensure that a more complete value chain analysis is \\nundertaken, which will include resource efficiency, in order to match current legislative discussions \\naround circularity and critical materials-use, including responsible sourcing  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n161 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n3.1   Manufacture of Low carbon technologies  \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\nC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Manufacturing \\n \\n\\nCode \\n\\nNo specific NACE code \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nManufacture of low carbon technologies \\n\\nMitigation criteria \\n\\nPrinciple \\n\\nThreshold \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Manufacturing of products, key components, and machinery that are \\n\\nessential for eligible renewable energy technologies \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Manufacture of eligible low carbon transport vehicles, fleets and vessels. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Manufacture of eligible energy efficiency equipment for buildings  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Manufacture of other low carbon technologies that result in substantial \\n\\nGHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including \\nprivate households) \\n\\nThe manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG \\nemission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private \\nhouseholds) is eligible provided that product related emissions are at least the \\nlevel of best available techniques i.e. a factory that produces electric cars, but \\nburns coal is not eligible). \\n\\n1.

All other plants need to \\nmeet the thresholds for cement or alternative binder  \\n\\n(A)  Cement clinker:  \\n\\nSpecific emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EU-\\nETS benchmarks) associated to the clinker production processes are lower \\nthan the value of the related EU-ETS benchmark. \\n\\nAs of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmark value for cement clinker \\nmanufacturing is: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker198  \\n\\n(B)  Cement:  \\n\\nSpecific emissions associated to the clinker and cement production \\nprocesses are lower than: 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement or alternative binder199 \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nCement production is responsible for more than 70% of the emissions under C.23 and concrete is the \\nmost  significant  application  for  the  use  of  cement.  Cement  is  the  main  constituent  of  concrete.  The \\ncontent  of  cement  in  the  concrete  and  total  GHG  emissions  can  vary  significantly  based  on  the \\n\\n \\n\\n198 Based on the EU ETS benchmark for grey cement clinker (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\\ncontent/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D0278&from=EN ). The threshold for cement clinker needs to be revised every time that \\nthere is an update in the EU ETS benchmark value for grey cement clinker.  \\n\\n199 Threshold was derived taking into account the threshold for cement clinker and the threshold for clinker to cement ratio. It \\nexcludes emissions from electricity use that is mainly required for finish grinding, raw materials grinding and the exhaust fans \\n(kiln/raw mill and cement mill). \\n\\n \\n\\n167 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nspecifications of the application that concrete will be used for. For this reason, manufacturing of concrete \\n(Concrete - NACE C.23.6) is not covered by the sustainable Taxonomy.  \\n\\nCement manufacture includes three main stages:  \\n\\n1.  Raw materials preparation; \\n2.  Clinker production;  \\n3.  Grinding  of  clinker  with  other  components  such  as  gypsum,  fly  ash,  ground  granulated  blast \\n\\nfurnace slag (GGBFS) and fine limestone to produce the finished cement.  \\n\\nTypically, 30\\xe2\\x80\\x9140% of direct CO2 emissions comes from the combustion of fuels; the remaining 60\\xe2\\x80\\x9170% \\ncomes from the chemical reactions involved in converting limestone to calcium oxide200. \\n\\nReducing the emissions from the manufacturing process of cement can therefore positively contribute to \\nthe mitigation objective.  \\n\\nThe absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the  maximum  acceptable \\ncarbon intensity that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the \\nmitigation objective.  \\n\\nETS product benchmarks have been selected as one of the thresholds for cement clinker production. \\nThey reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector.  \\n\\nWithin cement manufacture, the following activities were taken into account: \\n\\n1.  Process emissions: Emissions from the calcination process for the production of cement clinker \\n2.  Fuel emissions: Energy required for the calcination process during the clinker production \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  cement  production  facilities  that  meet  the  identified  threshold  are  expected  to  achieve  thermal \\nenergy intensity in the range of 2.9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 3,4 GJ/t clinker.    \\n\\n \\n\\nThreshold calculations:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Cement clinker: Specific emissions: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker (EU\\xe2\\x80\\x91ETS)  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Clinker to cement ratio:  0.65201 \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Specific emissions: 0.766x0.65 = 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement (or alternative binder) \\n\\n \\n\\nElectricity: Indirect emissions from the use of electricity during the clinker and cement production  \\n\\nThe main users of electricity in cement plants are the mills (grinding of cement, milling of raw materials) \\nand the exhaust fans (kiln/raw mill and cement mill, which together account for more than 80% of the \\nelectrical energy usage. The electricity demand in cement plants ranges from 90 to 150 kWh/t cement202.  \\n\\n \\n\\n200 https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry  \\n\\n201 As weighted average for the total production of the facility.

The CSI data cover more than \\n900 plants worldwide, and all technologies and clinker and cement types. The variations in the data are \\nsignificant: The 10% best in class show figures of 85 kWh/t cement and below, while the 90% percentile \\namounted to 129 kWh/t cement. \\n\\nTaking  into  account  that  the  decarbonisation  of  the  cement  sector  will  run  in  parallel  with  the \\ndecarbonisation of the energy sector, it is expected that the electricity required (as auxiliary power) for \\ncement manufacture in the near future will come from renewable sources and thus a specific threshold \\nfor  specific  electricity  consumption  is  not  proposed.  Based  on  the  above-mentioned  information  and \\nsources, it is expected that the best in class plants have specific electricity consumption of 85 KWh/ t \\ncement.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nImproving energy efficiency: Thermal energy intensity of clinker and the electric intensity of \\ncement can be reduced by deploying existing state-of-the-art technologies in new cement plants \\nand retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance levels when economically viable.  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Switching  to  alternative  fuels:  The  carbon  intensity  of  cement  clinker  can  be  reduced \\nsignificantly  by the use of biomass and  waste materials as fuels  in cement kilns. The clinker-\\nburning  process  offers  good  conditions  for  using  different  types  of  waste  materials  replacing \\nparts  of  the  consumption  of  carbon-intensive  fossil  fuels.  A  wide  range  of  different  types  of \\nwastes can be used as fuels but as these can replace primary fuel in cement kilns, a consistent \\nwaste quality is essential (e.g. adequate calorific value, metal, halogen and ash content). \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Reducing the clinker to cement ratio: Increasing the use of blended materials and the market \\ndeployment  of  blended  cements  is  very  important  for  the  decarbonisation  of  the  sector  and \\nalignment with a low carbon pathway.  This requires substitution of cement clinker by mineral \\nadditives such as fly ash, silica fume or blast-furnace slag. The amount of clinker substitute that \\ncan  be  blended  in  the  cement  depends  on  the  type  of  substitute  and  the  type  of  cement \\nproduced. Some mineral additives, e.g. GBFS, allow for substitution levels of over 70 per cent. \\nRevision  of  the  cement  and  concrete  standards,  building  codes  and  public  procurement \\nregulations would be required in order to allow more widespread use of blended cements with \\nvery high substitution of clinker (e.g. >60%)  while ensuring product reliability and durability  at \\nfinal application. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Alternative  clinkers  and  binders:  Alternative  clinker  formulations  (e.g.  belite,  CSA,  BCSA, \\nCACS,  MOMS)  and  alternative  binders  (e.g.  alkali-activated  binders)  could  offer  potential \\nopportunities  for  CO2  emissions  reductions  by  using  different  mixes  of  raw  materials  or \\nalternatives compared to Portland cement. Their commercial availability and applicability differ \\nwidely.  Further  efforts  are  required  to  support  the  demonstration,  testing  and  earlier  stage \\nresearch  for  alternative  clinkers  and  binders  and  to  develop  standards  to  facilitate  market \\ndeployment. The specification of the benchmark based on ton of binder will allow investments in \\nthese types of novel alternative binders to be considered for eligibility under the EU Sustainable \\nTaxonomy. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Renewable energy generation and use: Electricity supplied from renewable energy sources \\ncould be explored as a measure to reduce carbon  intensity of the final cement product. This can \\n\\n203 https://docs.wbcsd.org/2017/06/CSI_ECRA_Technology_Papers_2017.pdf  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n169 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nbe achieved through different strategies including implementing renewable-based captive power \\ngeneration,  power  purchase  agreements  that  ensure  electricity  imports  are  provided  from \\nrenewable sources or demand-side response strategies that enable a flexible electricity demand \\n(e.g.  a  flexible  operating  strategy  of  grinding  plants  throughout  the  day).  Various  renewable-\\nbased options are available for cement manufacturers including wind power, solar photovoltaic \\npower,  solar  thermal  power  and  small  hydropower  generation.  Potential  deployment  of  these \\ntechnologies in cement plants is highly dependent on local conditions. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Transportation emissions: The emissions from transportation are excluded as these \\n\\nrepresent only a small percentage of the total emissions of cement manufacture. \\n\\nAdditional information: \\n\\nEuropean Commission, Report.

No additional mitigation criteria \\nneed to be met. \\n\\nRationale \\n\\n-  Emissions related to the manufacturing of aluminium are primarily related to the use of electricity. \\n-  Electricity costs contribute to over 50% of the production costs. Consequently, there is a strong \\n\\nincentive for the aluminium industry to aim for improving energy efficiency.  \\n\\n-  The key action for aluminium production  to make a substantial contribution to climate change \\nmitigation is to increase its share of use of low carbon electricity. It is acknowledged that on the \\nshort term the availability low carbon electricity may be a limiting factor, depending on the region. \\nThis  will  change  in  on  the  medium  term,  when  sufficient  low  carbon  electricity  will  become \\navailable. \\n\\n- \\n\\n-  The second action for aluminium production to make a substantial contribution to climate change \\nmitigation is to decrease the process\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for \\non-site energy production \\nIt is acknowledged that aluminium production facilities can play an important role in stabilizing \\nelectricity  grids  by  active  management  of  electricity  demand.  This  may  result  in  substantial \\nmitigation contributions, e.g. by limiting the need for electricity storage facilities. However, given \\nthe lack of available metrics to quantify these impacts, these benefits are not taken into account \\nat this stage.  \\nIt is acknowledged that aluminium will play a role in a low carbon economy, in particular \\nenabling light weight products and electrification (including transmission wires).

However, \\ngiven that the EU ETS benchmarks are for specific steps of production, the TEG recommends that the \\nSustainable Finance Platform analyses the possibility to define a threshold for the overall integrated \\nsteel plant using the methodology set in the standard EN 19694-2:2016. \\n\\nIn the long-term, the steel and iron making industry should aim at implementing breakthrough \\ntechnologies (characterised by ultra-low CO2 emissions).

The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum \\nacceptable carbon intensity of the manufacturing process that the activity should comply with in order to \\nbe able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective.  \\n\\nThe selected threshold for nitric acid is the ETS product benchmark.

ELECTRICITY, GAS, STEAM AND AIR CONDITIONING SUPPLY  \\n\\nWhy heat and electricity generation is included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nHeat and electricity generation are responsible for over a quarter of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greenhouse gas \\nemissions.237 Ambitious emissions reductions in this sector are vital to decarbonisation. The Taxonomy \\nwork on the heat and power sector has attempted to recognise this finding by developing suitably \\nambitious requirements within a model of supporting a transition to the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emission reduction goals. \\n \\nCriteria: Metrics and Thresholds \\n\\nThis section covers a wide range of activities pertaining to the production, storage and delivery of heat \\nand electrical energy. Technology-agnostic criteria have been developed for different sources of \\nelectricity and heating and cooling. This section also recognizes the important role that improvements to \\nthe supporting infrastructure associated with delivering both types of energy will play in meeting the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nnet-zero emissions objective. The TEG has developed these Taxonomy criteria for the energy sector so \\nthey can be used globally. \\n\\nAn overarching, technology-agnostic emissions intensity threshold of 100g CO2e / kWh is proposed for \\nelectricity generation, heat production and the co-generation of heat and electricity. This threshold will be \\nreduced every five years in line with political targets set out to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.  \\n \\nFor electricity and heat generation activities, an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard \\ncompliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment including measurement of fugitive emissions is \\nrequired,. This includes actual physical measurements of methane leakage from the point of \\nextraction/well-head to production of energy (electricity and/or heat). The TEG acknowledges that \\nimproved standards and methodologies will develop and recommend that the acceptance of the ISO \\n14067, GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the PCF methodologies is reviewed periodically \\nreviewed by the platform.  \\n \\nTo aid the transition to a net-zero economy, certain technologies, such as solar, wind and tidal energy are \\nderogated from the requirement to conduct PCFs assessments on the basis that these technologies \\ncurrently perform significantly below the emissions intensity threshold. These derogations are subject to \\nregular review in accordance with the declining threshold.  \\n \\nFurthermore, In the case where CCS is used to meet the emissions intensity threshold, a contractual \\nagreement is required as proof to show that the carbon will be transported and sequestered in economic \\nactivities which are themselves eligible under the taxonomy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n237 Greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity according to the NACE classification EU-28, \\n2016.  Eurostat (env_ac_ainah_r2) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Climate_change_-\\n_driving_forces#Total_emissions.2C_main_breakdowns_by_source_and_general_drivers. \\n\\n \\n\\n205 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nMethod for selecting the emissions intensity threshold \\n\\nThe EU annual power sector emissions trajectory will need to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in \\naccordance with the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Paris Agreement and other climate and energy policy commitments.  \\n\\nThe calculation of the 100g CO2e / kWh threshold is based on the political targets for future allowed \\nemissions from the power sector, divided by the expected evolution of electricity demand. \\n\\nThe threshold will be set at a single value for all new investments in electricity generation, until it is \\nrevised in future. It applies equally to the production of heating / cooling and co-generation of heat and \\nelectricity.  \\n\\nFor a given investment or activity to be compatible with this trajectory, its average emissions over its \\nphysical lifetime, or 40 years (whichever is shorter), must be lower than the threshold. \\n\\nThe TEG recognizes that complementary emissions reductions activities (such as CCS or direct air \\ncapture with sequestration in a manner consistent with the corresponding EU Environmental Liability \\nDirective Annex II page 12), may be attributed to an economic activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emissions intensity as subject to \\nthe relevant activity threshold. \\n\\nThe threshold was determined as follows: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Historical power sector emissions and electricity demand data for EU28 are sourced from Eurostat. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Future emissions are in line with EU political commitments for the ETS sector (-43% by 2030), then \\n\\nlinearly decline to zero by 2050. Future electricity demand (net generation) is assumed to grow as per \\nthe EU 2016 PRIMES Reference Scenario.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Dividing the projected power sector emissions by the projected electricity demand results in policy-\\n\\nconsistent projected annual values for emissions factors of the EU power sector.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  A given power generator is considered aligned with these policy targets if its emissions are below the \\n\\naverage of these annual emissions factors over its lifetime. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  To determine a single technology-neutral threshold covering all technologies, the methodology \\n\\nconsiders the average annual emissions factors over a period of 40 years 238 from the time of \\ncommissioning. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The above calculation results in a threshold that varies by year of commissioning. To avoid updating it \\n\\nannually, and to provide some stability and certainty for investors, the threshold value is fixed for a \\n\\n \\n\\n238 Power plants can have typical lifetimes of between 15 and over 100 years, depending on technology, operating mode and \\nmaintenance profile. 40 years is the maximum period over which the large majority of power plants can reasonably be expected to \\noperate and emit GHGs without some form of repowering.  \\n\\n \\n\\n206 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nperiod of 5 years239 from 2020 and will be revised in 2025. It is set at the minimum value of calculated \\nannual threshold values over this 5-year period. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  This calculation, rounded to the nearest 5g, results in a threshold value of 100 gCO2e/kWh for the \\n\\npower sector. \\n\\nAlthough the 100 gCo2e/kWh threshold is derived from power sector assumptions, it will apply equally to \\nboth electricity and heating/cooling generation. \\n\\nDuring future reviews of the threshold, actual energy sector emissions and generation, as well as long \\nterm projections and policy targets will be updated as necessary. \\n\\nThese criteria imply that:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Unabated natural-gas fired power generation is not expected to meet the required threshold. Gas-\\n\\nfired power with carbon capture and sequestration may qualify.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Blended gas-fired power: Co-combustion of multiple gases for the production of electricity, heat/cool \\n\\nand co-generation is also subject to the emissions intensity threshold. This includes combustion of \\nRED II gases.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n Hydropower: the embedded emissions associated with the construction of hydropower facilities and \\nthe alteration of landscapes constitute a significant portion of lifecycle analysis emissions. Such \\nemissions can be compensated for, by a complementary emissions reduction activity as mentioned \\nabove.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Although the Taxonomy focuses on non-solid fossil fuel and renewable power, the DNSH to \\n\\nmitigation criteria are technology agnostic.  \\n\\nThe TEG has also developed criteria for other economic activities across the energy sector including: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Transmission and distribution of electricity \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Storage of energy \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Retrofit of gas transmission and distribution networks \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The manufacture of biofuels and biogas \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The operation of district heating and cooling networks \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nInstallation and operation of heat pumps \\n\\n239 A 5-year period is consistent with the typical development time for most generation projects (3 to 5 years). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n207 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The cogeneration of heating/cooling and power \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The production of heating/cooling \\n\\n \\nBrief summary of the stakeholder feedback on electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning \\n\\nThe energy working group thanks all respondents to energy criteria for their time and effort invested to \\nprovide input and help improve the energy taxonomy criteria. The following brief summary tries to \\nhighlight key feedback. The energy working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in \\ndeveloping this report. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Stakeholders highlighted that there are different levels of detail and ambition across the different \\n\\nactivities. Stakeholders noted this might not fully be technology neutral. This includes some \\ntechnologies being exempted from LCE analysis requirements. Other respondents suggested \\nincreasing the exemption list from LCE assessments. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The EU Taxonomy should be aligned with current legislation (particularly the Renewable Energy \\n\\nDirective) for DNSH and bioenergy, as outlined by some respondents. Where there are standards \\nand requirements, it was suggested making reference to them within the EU Taxonomy. Some \\nrespondents also noted that the EU Taxonomy should be structured in a way that minimises \\nadditional burden.   \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Respondents commented on the proposed thresholds, often considering them as too ambitious or too \\n\\nunambitious. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The suggested ISO 14044 criteria to be used for LCE assessments seems not being specific enough, \\n\\nand might not providing enough guidance for LCE assessments according to some respondents. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIn addition to the feedback received on the activities covered within the Technical Report for the EU \\nTaxonomy from June 2019, several stakeholders would have liked to see the inclusion or a stronger \\nacknowledgement of nuclear energy, waste-to-energy and unabated natural gas.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Some feedback implies that more explanation on the rationale on principles, metrics and threshold \\n\\nwould have been helpful. \\n\\nOutlook \\n\\nEnergy criteria in the EU Taxonomy will require further refinement and development to ensure topicality \\nand market coherence. This will encompass: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Adjustments to thresholds: energy thresholds should be revisited on a five-year basis, in order to \\nreflect state of the art research and progress on decarbonisation efforts. Particularly, the emission \\nthreshold for electricity generation should be reduced every five years.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Adjustment of DNSH criteria: the criteria should be revisited and adjusted in accordance with the \\n\\ndevelopment of further taxonomy criteria on other environmental objectives and advances in \\nresearch. \\n\\n \\n\\n208 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nInclusion of new technologies: technological progress could allow for market entry in the near future. \\nTechnologies with a sufficiently high technology readiness level (TRL) could be added to the \\nTaxonomy (e.g. nuclear fusion).  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Development of further metrics: as energy markets decarbonise and deployment patterns of certain \\n\\ntechnologies change, some activities (e.g. storage of electricity) might require the development of \\nfurther metrics.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The TEG also recognises that the use of biomass for energy requires trade-off decisions relative to \\nother potential uses and across mitigation activities, but also for do no significant harm dimensions. \\nFor these reasons, the TEG recognises that possible production and use of bioenergy will require \\nfurther consideration as the Taxonomy is developed and based on technical feedback in the outreach \\nperiod. \\n\\nMarket impact \\n\\nThe TEG adopted a technology-neutral approach that can ensure rapid decarbonisation within the \\nelectricity sector. Adherence to the declining emissions intensity threshold is technically feasible for \\nvirtually any energy generation technology. However, it does imply that unabated fossil fuel combustion, \\nnamely coal and natural gas, will be ineligible under the Taxonomy.  \\n\\nTEG deliberations on waste-to-energy \\n\\nOn waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinions differed on whether \\nthis would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to \\nclimate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. These \\nhighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of some \\nindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasing \\ncapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuse \\nand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy that could deliver higher climate mitigation benefits. \\nOn the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circular \\neconomy, as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in its \\nCommunication COM(2017)34 on \\xe2\\x80\\x98the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Section 5). \\nAccording to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significant \\nincrease in the incineration (including WtE) of waste is not considered an eligible activity, as it causes \\nharm to the environmental objective of the circular economy, as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomy \\nregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception was \\nnot part of the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity \\nharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, but \\nrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable \\nFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text. \\n \\n\\nTEG deliberations on nuclear energy \\n\\nThe TEG assessed nuclear energy as part of its review on energy generation activities. Nuclear energy \\ngeneration has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy generation phase and can be a \\ncontributor to climate mitigation objectives. Consideration of nuclear energy by the TEG from a climate \\nmitigation perspective was therefore warranted. \\n\\nThe proposed Taxonomy regulation and thus TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s methodology for including activities in the Taxonomy \\nexplicitly includes two equally important aspects, Substantial Contribution to one environmental objective \\n\\n \\n\\n209 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nand Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the other environmental objectives. In making its \\nrecommendations, the TEG used evidence and expert opinion from others, but ultimately was mandated \\nto make recommendations about the inclusion of economic activities and screening criteria in the \\nTaxonomy. \\n\\nEvidence on the potential substantial contribution of nuclear energy to climate mitigation objectives was \\nextensive and clear. The potential role of nuclear energy in low carbon energy supply is well \\ndocumented.240,241, \\n\\nOn potential significant harm to other environmental objectives, including circular economy and waste \\nmanagement, biodiversity, water systems and pollution, the evidence about nuclear energy is complex \\nand more difficult to evaluate in a taxonomy context. Evidence often addresses different aspects of the \\nrisks and management practices associated with nuclear energy. Scientific, peer-reviewed evidence of \\nthe risk of significant harm to pollution and biodiversity objectives arising from the nuclear value chain \\nwas received and considered by the TEG 242,243,244. Evidence regarding advanced risk management \\nprocedures and regulations to limit harm to environmental objectives was also received. This included \\nevidence of multiple engineered safeguards, designed to reduce the risks. Despite this evidence, there \\nare still empirical data gaps on key DNSH issues. \\n\\nFor example, regarding the long-term management of High-Level Waste (HLW), there is an international \\nconsensus that a safe, long-term technical solution is needed to solve the present unsustainable \\nsituation. A combination of temporary storage plus permanent disposal in geological formation is the most \\npromising, with some countries are leading the way in implementing those solutions. Yet nowhere in the \\nworld has a viable, safe and long-term underground repository been established245,246. It was therefore \\ninfeasible for the TEG to undertake a robust DNSH assessment as no permanent, operational disposal \\nsite for HLW exists yet from which long-term empirical, in-situ data and evidence to inform such an \\nevaluation for nuclear energy. \\n\\n \\n\\n240 IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change.

The TEG has therefore not recommended the inclusion of nuclear energy in the Taxonomy at \\nthis stage. Further, the TEG recommends that more extensive technical work is undertaken on the DNSH \\naspects of nuclear energy in future and by a group with in-depth technical expertise on nuclear life cycle \\ntechnologies and the existing and potential environmental impacts across all objectives. \\n\\nTEG recommendations for further work:  \\n\\nThe experts identified further economic activities which could be relevant for the Taxonomy. However, \\nconstrained by limited manpower, these activities could not be assessed in detail and are for future \\nconsideration by the Platform. Such economic activities may include:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The ownership, operation and recycling of energy storage facilities.  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Other gas infrastructure, except pipelines, which are relevant to the switch to hydrogen and zero-\\n\\ncarbon gases and the recycling of existing gas infrastructure.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  CCU applications, which ensure CO2 retention, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Other eligible energy (electricity, co-gen, heat/cool) assets that can be included for example, \\n\\nproduction of heat/cool from ocean energy.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the TEG acknowledges that improved standards and methodologies will develop and \\nrecommend that the acceptance of the ISO 14067, GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the \\nPCF methodologies is reviewed periodically reviewed by the platform.   \\n \\nFinally, criteria for manufacture of biomass, biogas and biofuels, and use of these fuels in energy and \\ntransport are currently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 (34) of the EU Renewable Energy \\nDirective II (Directive (EU) 2018/2001). For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may \\noffer substantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to \\nconsider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation.  \\n \\nSimilarly, the TEG recommends that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria \\nfor the manufacture of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined by \\nArticle 2 (36) under the Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as this has been included in the Transport criteria of \\nthe Taxonomy.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n211 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n4.1   Production of Electricity from Solar PV \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nD - Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\n4 \\n\\nCode \\n\\nD.35.1.1 \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nConstruction and operation of electricity generation facilities that produce \\nelectricity from Solar Photovoltaic \\n\\nMitigation criteria \\n\\nPrinciple \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Support a transition to a net-zero emissions economy \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Avoidance of lock-in to technologies which do not support the transition to \\n\\na net-zero emissions economy \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Ensure that economic activities meet best practice standards \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Ensure equal comparability within an economic activity with regards to \\n\\nachieving net-zero emissions economy target \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Where necessary, incorporating technology-specific considerations into \\n\\nsecondary metrics and thresholds \\n\\nMetric & \\nThreshold \\n\\nAny electricity generation technology can be included in the taxonomy if it can be \\ndemonstrated, using an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle \\nStandard-compliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment, that the life \\ncycle impacts for producing 1 kWh of electricity are below the declining threshold.   \\n\\nDeclining threshold: Facilities operating at life cycle emissions lower than \\n100gCO2e/kWh, declining to net-0gCO2e/kWh by 2050, are eligible.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  This threshold will be reduced every 5 years in line with a net-zero CO2e \\n\\nin 2050 trajectory \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Assets and activities must meet the threshold at the point in time when \\n\\ntaxonomy approval is sought \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  For activities which operate beyond 2050, it must be technically feasible to \\n\\nreach net-zero emissions in scope 1 emissions. \\n\\nHowever: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Solar PV is currently derogated from performing a PCF or GHG lifecycle \\n\\nassessment subject to regular review in accordance with the declining \\nthreshold. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Solar PV is currently deemed to be taxonomy eligible, which is subject to \\n\\nregular review. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nAn over-arching, technology-agnostic emissions threshold of 100g CO2e / kWh is proposed for the \\nelectricity generation.

In such a case, the weighted average \\nemissions factor across all included control areas is used to determine \\neligibility, and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systems \\nwithin this System will not be required to demonstrate compliance \\nseparately. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIt is possible for a System to become ineligible after having previously \\nbeen eligible. In Systems that become ineligible, no new T&D activities \\nare eligible from that moment onward, until the system is again in \\ncompliance with the threshold (except for those activities which are \\nalways eligible, see above). Activities in subordinated Systems may still \\nbe eligible, if these subordinated Systems meet the criteria of this \\nTaxonomy. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  A direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection to \\n\\nproduction plants includes infrastructure that is indispensable to carry the \\nassociated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation or \\nnetwork. \\n\\n \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nIncreasing access to electricity will support its decarbonisation by enabling more consumers to \\ntransition from carbon-intensive energy supply, while increasing the utilisation of renewable energy. \\nAs countries continue to fulfil their decarbonisation objectives, there will be fewer and fewer \\ninvestments in transmission and distribution which are not climate aligned.  \\n\\n \\n\\nUnder this logic, we propose that most investments in electricity transmission and distribution \\ninfrastructure in Systems where a significant majority of new generation capacity is from low carbon \\ngeneration sources should be considered climate-aligned under the EU Taxonomy.  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid, \\nthe structures and conductors required for various voltages, the extent to which pre-existing \\ncorridors are used, and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained. \\nThe most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure \\nare visual, ecosystem and land use.

WATER, SEWERAGE, WASTE AND REMEDIATION  \\n\\nWhy is water, sewerage, waste and remediation included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nThe sub-sector Water, Sewerage, Waste and Remediation (WSWR) covering NACE-Codes E36 to E39 \\ncontributes to a rather small share of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total greenhouse gas emissions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 water with 0.2% and \\nsewerage, waste, remediation with 4.4% in 2016. However, advanced solid waste management has a \\ngreat potential to trigger greenhouse gas emission reductions in other sectors of the economy through \\nwaste prevention, separate waste collection, waste reuse and recycling. \\n\\nWhat is covered \\n\\nIn the waste sector, a systems approach describing the climate mitigation effects of an integrated \\npackage of closely interrelated and combined environmentally sustainable activities would have its merits. \\nAs, however, the scope of the Taxonomy subgroup was to define stand-alone activities, the chosen \\nclimate mitigation principles, metrics and thresholds were formulated in a way to allow for the assessment \\nof singular activities without consideration of their linkages in a complex waste management system \\n(respectively, waste hierarchy). \\n\\nThe TEG and the experts involved assessed the NACE codes for WSWR and identified nine economic \\nactivities that offer a substantial contribution for climate mitigation: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E36.0.0 Water collection, treatment and supply: 1. Water collection, treatment and supply \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E37.0.0 Sewerage: 2. Centralized wastewater treatment; 3. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.1.1 Collection of non-hazardous waste: 4. Separate collection and transport of non-hazardous \\n\\nwaste in source segregated fractions \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.1.2 Collection of hazardous waste: - \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.2.1 Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste: 5. Anaerobic digestion of bio-waste; \\n\\n6. Composting of bio-waste \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.2.2 Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste: - \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.3.1 Dismantling of wrecks: - \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E38.3.2 Recovery of sorted materials: 7. Material recovery from non-hazardous waste  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  E39.0.0 Remediation activities: 8. Landfill gas capture and utilization; 9. Carbon Capture and Storage \\n\\nNACE Codes \\xe2\\x80\\x98E38.1.2 collection of hazardous waste\\xe2\\x80\\x99, \\xe2\\x80\\x98E38.2.2 treatment and disposal of hazardous \\nwaste\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98E38.3.1 dismantling of wrecks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (e.g. automobiles, ships, etc.) were found to be of less \\nrelevance from a climate mitigation perspective and thus reprioritized for later consideration by the \\nPlatform on Sustainable Finance (see section on \\xe2\\x80\\x98next steps\\xe2\\x80\\x99 further below). \\n\\n \\n\\n287 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nOn waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinions differed on whether \\nthis would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to \\nclimate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. These \\nhighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of some \\nindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasing \\ncapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuse \\nand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy and that can deliver higher climate mitigation \\nbenefits. On the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly \\ncircular economy as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in its \\nCommunication COM(2017)34 on \\xe2\\x80\\x98the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Section 5). \\nAccording to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significant \\nincrease in the incineration, including WtE, of waste is not considered an eligible activity as it causes \\nharm to the environmental objectives of the circular economy as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomy \\nregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception was \\nnot part of the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity \\nharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, but \\nrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable \\nFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text.  \\n\\nTEG Call for Public Feedback on its Report on EU Taxonomy, June 2019 \\n\\nThe main issues raised in the public feedback on activities in the subsector WSWR related to broadening \\nthe scope of some activities: For \\xe2\\x80\\x98anaerobic digestion of bio-waste\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and similar for \\xe2\\x80\\x98anaerobic digestion of \\nsewage sludge\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98landfill gas capture and utilization\\xe2\\x80\\x99, respondents suggested to allow for additional \\nuses of the produced biogas or landfill gas. For the \\xe2\\x80\\x98anaerobic digestion of bio-waste\\xe2\\x80\\x99, respondents \\nwarned against the exclusion of certain crops and against the exclusion of blending of feedstocks. Both \\nissues are reflected in the revised criteria.  \\n\\nSetting criteria and thresholds \\n\\nAn important characteristic of subsector WSWR is that for the identified activities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the exception of \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98water collection, treatment and supply\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of key \\ncharacteristic of the corresponding business model, for example the energetic utilization of bio-gas \\nproduced through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and bio-waste, or the material recovery from \\nwaste for reuse or recycling in other sectors. Hence, the choice of climate mitigation criteria mainly \\nfocuses on (qualitative) metrics that seek to securing the execution of the activities/businesses \\nthemselves.  \\n\\nOnly in \\xe2\\x80\\x98water collection, treatment and supply\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely water supply \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the climate mitigation effect is the \\nresult of a more efficient design of the production process (e.g. by raising pump efficiency or reducing \\nleakages). Consequently, concrete quantitative thresholds were defined, with a first option describing an \\nambitious level of high energy efficiency in the water collection, treatment and supply system, and with a \\nsecond option setting thresholds for the substantial improvement of the system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s energy efficiency.  \\n\\nGiven the heterogeneity of WSWR, it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria. This point \\nwas raised in the public consultation feedback. However, it is the view of the TEG that these criteria \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\neven if some are referencing to EU regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are globally relevant for the contribution of WSWR to a \\n\\n \\n\\n288 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nlow carbon economy and with the in-built flexibility on options for demonstrating compliance, they can be \\napplied globally. \\n\\nImpact of these proposals \\n\\nThe activities do not impose major additional implementation costs on the stakeholders because (as \\nexplained) for most of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 except \\xe2\\x80\\x98water collection, treatment and supply\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the climate mitigation \\neffects are an inherent result of key characteristics of the correspondent business models and thus \\nshould come along without significant further cost. Considering \\xe2\\x80\\x98water collection, treatment and supply\\xe2\\x80\\x99, \\nadditional investments may be necessary in order to reach certain thresholds, however the corresponding \\ncosts may partially be equalized by cost savings from higher energy efficiency. \\n\\nThere should be no systematic distortive effect of the activities on the number and competitive position of \\nthe companies in the corresponding sectors. The overall sectoral technological impact will depend on the \\nstate of the water, wastewater and waste management in each Member State in terms of e.g. regional \\ncoverage of different management technologies. Outside of the EU the technological impact could be \\neven greater if the state of the sector in an individual country or region is below that of the EU. \\n\\nClear additional beneficial environmental effects can be assumed for e.g. water, circular economy and \\npollution. Employment effects should be positive, and further beneficial economic impacts are induced \\nthrough increased investments and the demand for consumer goods. \\n\\nWhy carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nCarbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a key technology for the decarbonisation of Europe. It is \\nincluded in all pathways presented by the European Commission in its Long-Term Strategic Vision \\ndocument and is relied upon heavily in three-out-of-four scenarios outlined by the IPCC in the Special \\nReport on 1.5 Degrees. \\n\\nA  typical  CCS  chain  consists  of  three  main  stages:  capture,  transport  and  storage.  CO2  transport  and \\nstorage are established and proven processes, with decades of operation and well-established regulation \\nhere in Europe.   \\n\\nThe Technical Expert Group has developed criteria to define the eligibility of facilities used to capture carbon \\ndioxide directly from the atmosphere and, separately, to capture carbon dioxide directly from anthropogenic \\nactivities. \\n\\nCCS can be eligible in any sector/activity if it enables that primary activity to operate in compliance with the \\nthreshold - for example, steel, cement or electricity production.  \\n\\n \\nCapture \\n\\n \\nCCS facilitates the direct mitigation of both fossil and process emissions in many industrial sectors including \\nsteel,  cement  and  chemicals.  Time  is  a  crucial  factor:  the  later  options  for  deep  decarbonisation  in  an \\nindustry arise, the more costly they become, and the more likely the need for greater carbon dioxide removal \\n\\n \\n\\n289 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(CDR) in the future. 2050 is only one investment cycle away for many industries. Thus, decisions need to \\nbe made today. \\n\\nIn addition to renewable energies, energy storage and demand-side management, CCS on dispatchable \\ngeneration allows all aspects of the electricity supply system to be deeply decarbonised.284 CCS provides \\na backstop to the unabated operation of flexible electricity generation plants that are required to guarantee \\nthe operation and supply of year-round electricity. This is especially true in more isolated grids with a high \\npenetration of seasonally variable renewables (e.g. onshore and offshore wind) where the reliable operation \\nof electricity networks requires on-demand electricity generation.  \\n\\nThe availability of CCS means that no remaining segment of the electricity supply system will be capable \\nof emitting CO2 to the atmosphere. \\n\\nWhilst some CO2 capture technologies can incur an \\xe2\\x80\\x98energy penalty\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of 10-15%, others do not. For example, \\nthe Allam cycle being developed by Net Power on natural gas combustion for power generation does not \\nincur  an  energy  penalty,  as  supercritical  CO2  is  integrated  fully  into  the  power  cycle  as  a  coolant.  This \\nsignificantly reduces both energy and water demand. It is therefore inaccurate to say that CCS is a highly \\nenergy-intensive technology. \\n\\nTransport and Storage  \\n\\nThe  transport  and  storage  of  CO2  should  be  considered  essential  to  the  infrastructure  of  a  modern, \\nsustainable  society.  It  can  aid  electricity  grid  expansion,  the  integration  of  renewables  and  the  deep \\ndecarbonisation of energy intensive industries; support and enable CO2 removal; and help stimulate a green \\nhydrogen  market.  Without  CO2  transport  and  storage  infrastructure,  Europe  will  not  achieve  its  climate \\nobjectives. \\n\\nChemically, CO2 bonds with surrounding minerals after injection (gradual re-fossilisation), making CO2 \\nstorage sites safer as time progresses. The IPCC estimates that over 99.9% of CO2 will remain \\nunderground. The EU has provided clear and extensive assessment and monitoring requirements \\nthrough the 2009 CO2 Storage Directive. CO2 has already been safely stored in geological formations in \\nEurope for over 20 years. \\n\\n284 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ee/c6ee01120a#!divAbstract. \\n\\n \\n\\n290 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nThrough decade-long CO2 injection experiences in North America, and the monitoring of CO2 storage in \\nEurope, the safe final disposal of CO2 both on- and offshore has already been established. Selected \\nsources on risk and safety of CO2 storage can be found in the footnotes.285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294 \\n\\nNext steps \\n\\nThe Platform on Sustainable Finance to come is expected to review several activities: By 2025, the \\nthreshold in Option 2 of \\xe2\\x80\\x98water collection, treatment and supply\\xe2\\x80\\x99 will have to be assessed for adjustment \\nas the standards in the water supply sector and the technologies develop over time.

Several \\nenergy efficiency measures can reduce directly the energy consumption in a water supply system, \\nenabling significant reductions of GHG emissions, these are inter alia: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nto use more efficient sources in substitution of others more GHG demanding (e.g. surface \\nsources instead groundwater sources, by means of water harvesting), \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  more efficient pumping systems, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  digitalization and automation. \\n\\nfrequency variators, \\n\\nAn ILI of 1.5 represents a very efficient performance of the network with regards to water losses. ILI \\nincorporates  in  its  definition  the  length  of  the  supply  network,  which  makes  it  the  most  objective \\nparameter.  Water  losses  management  (reduction  of  the  ILI)  reduces  indirectly  the  energy \\nconsumption in the whole water supply system thus enabling significant reductions of GHG emissions \\nfrom the water supply system. Water loss management measures consist inter alia of:  \\n\\nspeed and quality of repairs, \\ninfrastructure and assets management (including maintenance), \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  active leakage control,  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  pressure management,  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  metering, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  monitoring and reporting, \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  digitalization and automation. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  water abstraction; \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  possible detrimental effects to ecosystems.  \\n\\nCompliance with relevant EU and respective national law as well as consistency with national, \\nregional or local water management strategies and plans is a minimum requirement. \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water \\nconsumption at the appropriate level.

As part of an integrated waste management system, AD is a valid route \\nto divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfill \\ngas, in particular methane. The AD process produces methane-rich biogas under controlled \\nconditions, and a sludge-like or liquid residue, termed \\xe2\\x80\\x98digestate\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Biogas can be used in multiple \\nforms and applications that displace fossil fuels.  \\n\\nThe digestate is typically used on farmland as organic fertilizer, directly or after a composting step. \\nThe use of digestate instead of synthetic fertilizers derived from by-products of the petroleum \\nindustry saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels. Where there is no immediate \\nuse on farmland, the digestate can be dewatered and \\xe2\\x80\\x98cured\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by composting to stabilise the \\nmaterial, which can be stored for longer time and used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver.  \\n\\nFor the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar bio-waste, AD exhibits the best \\nenvironmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biological \\ntreatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable. \\nThis depends on several local conditions.304  \\n\\nOn the other hand, biodegradable garden and park wastes and other bio-waste with high ligneous \\ncontent are typically not directly degradable by AD. Where such bio-waste fraction is significant, it \\nshould be collected separately and treated by composting (see Taxonomy Activity \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComposting of \\nbio-waste\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\n\\nCo-digestion of bio-wastes with solid or liquid manure and other agricultural residues as well as \\nenergy crops is sometimes practised to improve the stability of the AD process and increase biogas \\nyields and is eligible under the conditions mentioned in the metrics. Due care needs to be taken \\nhowever to ensure that the use of the digestate (or composts produced therefrom) as a fertilizer/soil \\nconditioner is not negatively affected by such practice.  \\n\\nMethane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be avoided. \\nSpecific monitoring is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities. Where \\nincreasing methane emissions are detected, it is in the interest of the operator to remove the causes \\nthrough technical or operational measures in order to minimize economic losses.305  \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to: \\n\\n \\n\\n304 Dri M., Canfora P., Antonopoulos I.

TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE \\n\\nWhy transport is included in the Taxonomy \\n\\nTo achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050 (compared to \\n1990). Road, rail, aviation, and waterborne transport will all have to contribute to the reduction321. \\n\\nCurrently transport operations consume one-third of all energy in the EU. The bulk of this energy comes \\nfrom oil. This means that transport is responsible for a large share of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greenhouse gas emissions \\nand is a major contributor to climate change. While most other economic sectors, such as industry, have \\nreduced their emissions since 1990, those from transport have risen (see Figure 1). Preliminary estimates \\nfrom EU Member States show that GHG emissions from transport were 29% above 1990 levels in 2018322 \\nThey now account for more than one quarter of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total greenhouse gas emissions. This presents a \\nmajor challenge in addressing transport sector emissions to ensure that the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emission reduction \\ntarget is met. Although vehicle efficiency improvements have had a mitigating effect on GHG emissions, \\ngrowing transport demand323 and a sluggish share of low-carbon solutions have outweighed it.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 1: GHG emission trends and projections under the scope of the Effort Sharing Decision \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: EEA, Trends and Projections in Europe 2019 (https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/trends-and-projections-in-europe-1) \\n\\n \\n\\n321 The European Green Deal,  COM(2019) 640 final \\n\\n322 https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/term/increasing-oil-consumption-and-ghg \\n\\n323 Passenger and freight transport demand: \\n\\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/passenger-and-freight-transport-demand/assessment. \\n\\n \\n\\n321 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nWithin the transport sector, road transport is the dominant emissions source, accounting for more than \\ntwo-thirds (71.7%324) of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars and vans are \\nresponsible for the bulk of these emissions, the rest resulting from trucks and buses. Road transport is \\nfollowed by shipping and aviation as the second and third largest sources of GHG emissions from \\ntransport.  \\n\\nThe transport sector represents about 30% of additional annual investment needs for sustainable \\ndevelopment in the Union.325 \\n\\nSubjects covered \\n\\nTo make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation, the activities and technical screening criteria \\n(hereafter \\xe2\\x80\\x98criteria\\xe2\\x80\\x99) included in the Taxonomy need to focus on the main emissions sources from the \\ntransport sector. Reducing the GHG emissions from road transport is therefore key. For road vehicles \\nthere is a well-developed legislative framework in the EU that includes mandatory emissions testing. This \\nsystem is most mature for cars and vans. It has recently evolved significantly for trucks, and buses are set \\nto follow.  \\n\\nRail and inland waterways are also important emissions sources covered by the Taxonomy. Compared to \\nroad and air, they can provide modal shift benefits. However, EU legislation provides less direct \\norientation regarding these modes of transport.  \\n\\nWhile public transport and the infrastructure for low-carbon transport in themselves are smaller sources of \\nGHG emissions, they are vital to achieve systemic change towards more sustainable mobility and are \\ntherefore also included in the Taxonomy.  \\n\\nScope \\n\\nThe transport section of the climate mitigation Taxonomy deals primarily with climate mitigation activities \\nregarding operations of vehicle/vessel fleets and the associated enabling infrastructure. The taxonomy \\ncriteria for the manufacturing of vehicles and vessels are addressed in Manufacturing and are based on \\nthe criteria in this section. \\n\\nThere are several principal options326 for climate mitigation in the transport sector including:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIncreasing the number of low- and zero emission vehicles, improving vehicle efficiency and \\ninfrastructure \\n\\n \\n\\n324 Greenhouse gas emissions from transport: \\n\\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/statistics/pocketbook-2019_en \\n\\n325 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate \\nSustainable Investment (COM (2018) 353 final). \\n\\n326 \\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA Clean Planet for All\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

For fleet efficiency criteria, tank-to-wheel criteria have been used since the \\nbasis for criteria is the Clean Vehicles Directive, the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans and the \\nHeavy Duty CO2 regulation. Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the \\npossibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology in future as per the above mentioned \\nlegislations.  \\n\\nEfficient, low- and zero direct emissions fleets \\n\\nThis category of criteria requires that operated fleets to become more efficient over time by linking \\neligibility to emissions performance below a certain threshold set to ensure substantially reduced \\nemissions. Thresholds are based on performance metrics (vehicle km, passenger km or tonne km). They \\nare mode specific and are linked to available testing methods where available. They require efficiency \\nimprovements without being technology prescriptive, so long as the benefits of relevant technologies can \\nbe demonstrated.  \\n\\nThe operation of vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions, or close to zero tailpipe emissions, is automatically \\neligible in the proposed criteria. Vehicle/vessel electrification is the main category in this context. This \\napproach is also motivated by ETS inclusion and the ongoing decarbonisation of the EU power sector. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n327 The European Green Deal,  COM(2019) 640 final \\n\\n328 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41897/st14970-ad01-en19.pdf \\n\\n329 \\'\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA Clean Planet for All\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

It is \\nacknowledged that for other regions the criteria proposed may not be applicable in defining substantial contributions to climate \\nchange mitigation. \\n\\n331 There is no intention on the part of the TEG to undermine the approach in existing regulations covering these different aspects \\n\\n \\n\\n323 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nFuel substitution to net-zero carbon fuels \\n\\nThe operation of vehicle fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low- or net-zero carbon fuels such \\nas advanced bio- and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO2 net emissions savings in \\nthe transport sector by enhancing climate neutral mobility.332 333,334,335,336,337.  \\n\\nIn the technical criteria below, the TEG considers a role for low- or net-zero carbon fuels in four activities \\nwhere they can offer substantial mitigation benefits, and where commercialisation of zero tailpipe \\nemissions vehicles or vessels is limited to date and where the operating conditions for the vehicles or \\nvessels may slow the implementation of zero direct emissions alternatives, including freight transport \\nservices by road; interurban scheduled road transport services of passengers; inland passenger water \\ntransport; inland freight water transport. The \\xe2\\x80\\x98Clean Planet for All\\xe2\\x80\\x99 states that a variety of fuels and \\npowertrains are likely to be needed for long haul heavy goods vehicles and long distance coaches. \\nFurthermore, the Communication from the Commission on the European Green Deal sets out the need to \\nto ramp up the production and deployment of sustainable alternative transport fuels. In this context, the \\nCommission has committed to consider legislative options to boost the production and uptake of \\nsustainable alternative fuels for the different transport modes. As the taxonomy is developed in future to \\ncover other activities, sustainable alternative fuels (such as advanced biofuels and electro-fuels produced \\nusing renewable energy) may also have a role to play e.g. in aviation and maritime shipping. \\n\\nThe proposed criteria limit their eligibility for use in certain modes and for dedicated fleets, where it is \\nunderstood that these fuels and the finance needed to support a shift can have a greater role to play from \\na climate mitigation perspective through the substitution of fossil fuels. In addition, it is noted in \\xe2\\x80\\x98A Clean \\nPlanet for All\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that land constraints imply that biofuels and biomethane should be deployed only in those \\ntransport modes or means where they are necessary. TEG notes that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to ensure that these \\nfuels are solely used to realise the maximum benefits of fuel substitution. As such, the criteria proposed \\nalso require a strict monitoring regime to ensure that these particular fuels are used. However, it is noted \\nthat blended fuels with very high levels of sustainable alternative fuels (such as advanced biofuels and \\nelectro-fuels produced using renewable energy) biofuels may also offer climate mitigation benefits, and \\ncould be considered by the Platform in future, particularly in respect to aviation and shipping. \\n\\nAs an example of how this might work in practice, a road freight transport operator may seek to operate a \\nnew or existing fleet of trucks solely using an eligible fuel (e.g. advanced fuel).

However, \\xe2\\x80\\x98modal shift\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nis not included as a distinct economic activity with associated criteria in the proposed Taxonomy due to \\nthe complexities of capturing it in a robust, unambiguous manner within the given Taxonomy architecture. \\nInstead, the proposed Taxonomy acknowledges the potential carbon savings from a modal shift338 and \\ntherefore sets similar thresholds across modes, which indirectly promotes modal shifts (e.g. a greater \\nproportion of fleets in lower carbon modes are Taxonomy eligible, facilitating investment in these \\nactivities). The relative emissions performance of modes will change over time as technologies evolve \\nand uptake increases, therefore the approach taken within the Taxonomy should be reviewed in the \\nfuture. \\n\\nStakeholder feedback \\n\\nThe feedback received on TEG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report from June 2019 with regard to the transport sector was in general \\npolarized with groups of respondents often advocating for technical criteria at opposite ends of the \\nspectrum.  After careful consideration of all feedback no major revisions were made of the proposed \\nsubstantial contribution criteria, although criteria and rationales have been fine-tuned and further clarified \\nwhere deemed necessary. Feedback on DNSH criteria have been received for most modes of transport \\nand has led to refinement and clarifications across the board. \\n\\nInternational applicability \\n\\nThe scope of economic activities and the type of criteria proposed in this section may help to inform the \\ndesign of technical criteria for the transport sector beyond the EU. However, the quantitative thresholds \\nproposed are EU focused by design given the EU taxonomy regulation itself, but also because they are \\nbased on EU legal reference points.  \\n\\nGuidance on Ex-Ante Assessments \\n\\nDetailed guidance should be established to assist in interpretation and implementation of the taxonomy. \\nFor transport, specific guidance will be required for how to undertake ex-ante assessments on utilisation \\nof transport, for example to establish if passenger-km or tonne-km criteria are met. The following is a \\nproposed guidance on methods for undertaking such assessments and are presented in order of \\npreference because the likely accuracy of resulting data: \\n\\na)  Demand forecasts and a reasoned analysis of the relation between capacity offered and demand;  \\n\\n338 Taxonomy regulation Article 14.3:  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41897/st14970-ad01-en19.pdf \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n325 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nb) \\n\\nIn case there is no modelling available actual load factor data from comparable operations should \\nbe used (for example actual data from fleets that are replaced by new fleets); \\n\\nc)  Local, regional or national benchmarks could be used as reference, where it provides a very clear \\n\\ndemonstration of meeting thresholds \\n\\nNext steps and recommendations \\n\\nAt this stage, there are other activities in the transport sector that have not been addressed, but which \\nneed consideration as part of further work on the Taxonomy, e.g. by the Platform on Sustainable Finance.  \\n\\nThese include: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Maritime shipping (including reference to EU MRV regime) \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Aviation \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nICT for transport \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Energy efficiency improvements in equipment and infrastructure (e.g. in ports) \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Research, development & innovation related activities having the potential to substantially \\n\\ndecarbonize the transport sector \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentifying or developing standardised methodologies and guidance for addressing the metric of the \\ncriteria where those are not yet specified \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Explore life-cycle considerations for criteria relating to fleets once EU-agreed methods have been \\n\\ndeveloped and agreed \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Consider development of criteria for infrastructure in future that take account of embedded carbon \\n\\nemissions in construction materials \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Criteria for manufacture of biomass, biogas and biofuels, and use of these fuels in transport are \\n\\ncurrently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 (34) of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II \\n(Directive (EU) 2018/2001),. For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offer \\nsubstantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to \\nconsider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation.  \\n\\nMaritime shipping has been considered by the TEG. Whilst it was evident that zero direct emissions fleets \\nshould be eligible as for other modes, criteria will also need to be established for short sea shipping \\nwhere modal shift benefits can be achieved. Furthermore, it will be also important to consider approaches \\nto maritime shipping based on the efficiency of transport fleets. Discussions in this area were not \\nconcluded during the timeframe of the TEG and should be continued in further work on the Taxonomy. \\nAviation was not considered within the scope of the work of the TEG but should be addressed in the \\nfuture considering the significance of emissions from the sector. In addition, ICT transport specific \\nsolutions and transport demand management can be important measures for enabling mitigation that \\nhave not been included at this stage but warrant further study.   \\n\\nFor a number of criteria, a review period is recommended as detailed in the tables that follow.  \\n\\n \\n\\n326 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n6.1   Passenger rail transport (interurban) \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nH - Transport and storage \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\n4 \\n\\nCode \\n\\nH49.1.0 \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nPassenger Rail Transport (Interurban) \\n\\nMitigation criteria \\n\\nPrinciple \\n\\nDemonstrate substantial GHG emission reduction by: \\n\\n-       Increasing the number of low- and zero emission fleets, and improving \\n\\nfleet efficiency \\n\\n-       Improving efficiency of the overall transport/mobility system \\n\\n \\n\\nCriteria \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Zero direct emissions trains are eligible.  \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Other trains are eligible if direct emissions (TTW) are below 50g CO2e \\n\\nemissions per passenger kilometre (gCO2e/pkm) until 2025 (non-\\neligible thereafter) \\n\\n \\nBrief rationale: \\nZero direct emissions rail (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero \\n\\ndirect emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the \\nlowest compared with other transport modes.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions \\n\\ntransport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future  \\n\\nThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity \\nremains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor \\n(50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than emissions for an average car in the \\ncurrent vehicle stock. \\n \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nZero direct emissions rail (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail \\n\\ntransport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport \\nmodes.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to \\n\\nbecome low or zero carbon in the near future  \\n\\nThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm  until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria \\nfor eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than \\n\\n \\n\\n327 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nemissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock (290 gCO2 /vkm339). This means that (diesel) \\npassenger rail transport emission activities will only be eligible when the carbon intensity of the vehicle \\ndivided by the number of actual passengers is similar to eligible low carbon road transport vehicles \\n(activity 24.5). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km) and not capacity offered (seat-\\nkm or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or ex-ante \\ndemand assessments.  The current average for EU diesel rail is 70-90 g CO2 /pkm340, so the threshold \\nis stringent enough to screen out most of the rail systems based on diesel operating in Europe as the \\nload factor would need to be higher than 60% to reach eligibility. However, it would still enable certain \\nhybrid systems of high efficiency to be eligible. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of rail \\ntransport activities are attributed to air pollution, noise and vibration, water use..

The Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation uses a g CO2/km metric. To \\nconvert this to a g CO2/tonne-km metric, the average payload for the road freight \\nvehicles should be applied. Once reference value data is available, it is expected \\nthat the taxonomy will specify CO2e/tkm threshold values. \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThe carbon intensity of freight rail, even if diesel, is in most cases significantly lower than road \\nfreight transport, rail freight transport at least meeting the threshold proposed in the road transport \\nHDV criteria is eligible.

Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to \\neligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure, with additional criteria relating to \\nzero carbon transport (active mobility)  \\n\\n \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport is considered eligible \\nbecause this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities \\nthat are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy.  \\n\\nCriteria 3. above would accommodate all electric rail lines and non-electrified lines with battery \\npowered and hydrogen trains operating. However even if non-electrified, there might be a case for \\nrenewal of rail infrastructure in order to ensure continuity of the service while alternative powered \\ntrains (hydrogen, battery) are deployed in the future years, hence the inclusion of criteria 4 above. \\nThere is no significant risk of lock-in in those cases where the fleet is due for renewal. \\n\\nIn criteria 3 above, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpredominantly used for\\xe2\\x80\\x9d should be interpreted to mean that the majority of the \\nuse of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other land \\ntransport activities identified in the taxonomy. Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet use \\ne.g. estimations based on future projections, a more conservative approach should be applied to \\nensure that the predominant use requirement will be met.    \\n\\nThere is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport \\nservice is eligible. Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that are \\nneeded to ensure the day-to-day delivery of a transport service e.g. tracks, IT equipment ensuring \\nservice delivery, ticket offices and fleet maintenance facilities. It does not include ancillary \\ninfrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the fleet e.g. head offices of the \\ntransport operator.  \\n\\nFor the criteria that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil \\nfuels is not eligible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdedicated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired with \\nthe explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels, even if actual use may serve other purposes as \\nwell.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIt is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects (e.g. upstream \\nemissions from manufacture of construction materials) may be significant in certain circumstances. \\nThe level of uncertainty around data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate \\nthis consideration within thresholds for infrastructure. However, this element should be considered \\nfor ongoing work on the Taxonomy. Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative \\nimpacts on climate change and therefore is excluded. \\n\\nICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible i.e. it meets one of the stated criteria and is \\nfundamental to the operation of the transport service. However it is recognised that wider ICT \\nactivities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this will \\nrequire future work to define criteria. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from infrastructure activities \\nare attributed to noise and vibration pollution, water contamination, waste generation and impacts \\non biodiversity (habitat and wildlife) and land use consumption with ecosystem impacts  specifically: \\n\\n336 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Contamination of water during construction and unsustainable use of water during \\n\\nconstruction and operations \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Unsustainable use of resources during constructions, e.g. generation of high amount of \\n\\nwaste, no recycling/reuse of construction waste \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Noise pollution can be relevant for both rolling stock and railway infrastructure as noise \\n\\ncan be generated by both rolling stock and poor conditions of rail tracks.353 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Construction of infrastructure can cause significant harm when taking place in protected \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nareas or areas of high biodiversity values outside protected areas.  \\nInfrastructure can cause fragmentation and degradation of the natural and urban \\nlandscape due to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbarrier\\xe2\\x80\\x9d effects of the infrastructure and can involve risks of \\nwildlife accidents caused by collisions. Railway infrastructure (in particular tunnels) can \\ncause change and degradation of hydromorphological conditions of water bodies and \\ntherefore have impacts on aquatic ecosystems. \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at \\nthe appropriate level.

The 50 g CO2/km threshold \\ndoes not apply to L vehicles (e.g. motorcycles) due to their lower weight and \\nhigh electrification potential.  \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThis activity includes operation of all vehicles classified as M1, N1, as defined by Regulation (EU) \\n2018/858, and of vehicles classified as category L (2- and 3-wheel vehicles and quadricycles) as \\ndefined in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013.

Taken together, these two pieces of EU legislation reflect the latest thinking on ambitious \\nand sufficiently mature performance metrics.

Eligibility should be reviewed latest by 2025, or \\nwhen Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is reviewed. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Other vehicles are eligible if direct emissions are below 50 gCO2e/pkm \\n\\nBrief rationale: \\nPassenger transport with zero tailpipe emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) \\nis eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become \\nlow or zero carbon in the near future. Dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly \\ndefined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively \\nhigh challenges in electrifying the vehicle category typically used on interurban \\nroutes. Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line \\nwith the agreed taxonomy regulation. The threshold of 50gCO2e/pkm relates to \\nthe thresholds set for passenger cars (assuming occupancy of one) and \\nrepresents a value that is significantly below average new car emissions.  \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to \\ncriteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower \\nthan average diesel car (290 gCO2/vkm367). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km) \\nand not capacity offered (seat-km or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoring \\ndata from operations or ex-ante demand assessments. \\n\\nUnlike urban buses, zero tailpipe emission vehicle technologies are not commercially available, \\ntherefore the threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that only \\nzero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyze the modal shift comparison with cars in \\ninterurban transport, and technology developments in the sector.   \\n\\nWith no commercial availability of zero tailpipe emission vehicles for this activity, fuel substitution to \\nadvanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for \\nsome transport modes in the medium term as identified in the EC Long term strategy368: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor those transport modes where the deployment of zero emission vehicles is unfeasible due to \\nenergy density requirements or technology costs, carbon neutral fuels (i.e. advanced biofuels and \\nbiomethane, as well as e-fuels) can be deployed for use in conventional vehicle engines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\n \\n\\n367 The factor represents urban operational emissions for the current average car in the vehicle stock (weighting the share of \\ndiesel, petrol, LPG, CNG, hybrid in the fleet). It does not represent emissions of new vehicles.

Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to \\n\\n \\n\\n396 At this stage, only criteria for inland waterway transport passenger and freight fleets are defined. The criteria for infrastructure \\ncould not be applied to non-zero direct emissions maritime shipping fleets until criteria for that type of activity is defined. \\n\\n \\n\\n356 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\neligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure, with additional criteria relating to \\ninfrastructure supporting the renewable energy sector.  \\n\\n \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport is considered eligible \\nbecause this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the activities \\nconsidered eligible under the rest of the water transport section of the Taxonomy.  \\n\\nCriteria 2 is a supply chain activity for renewable energy. It includes for example port facilities \\ndedicated to supporting the offshore wind power sector. \\n\\nIn criteria 3 above, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpredominantly used for\\xe2\\x80\\x9d should be interpreted to mean that the majority of the \\nuse of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other water \\ntransport activities identified in the taxonomy. Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet use \\ne.g. estimations based on future projections, a more conservative approach should be applied to \\nensure that the predominant use requirement will be met.    \\n\\nThere is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport \\nservice is eligible. Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that are \\nneeded to ensure the day-to-day delivery of a transport service e.g. fuelling/charging facilities. It \\ndoes not include ancillary infrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the \\nfleet e.g. head offices of the transport operator.  \\n\\nFor the criteria that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil \\nfuels is not eligible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdedicated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired with \\nthe explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels, even if actual use may serve other purposes as \\nwell. \\n\\nIt is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects (e.g. upstream \\nemissions from manufacture of construction materials) can be significant. The level of uncertainty \\naround data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate this consideration within \\nthresholds for infrastructure. However, this element should be considered for ongoing work on the \\nTaxonomy. \\n\\nTransport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and \\ntherefore is excluded.   \\n\\nICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible i.e. it meets one of the stated criteria and is \\nfundamental to the operation of the transport service. However, it is recognised that wider ICT \\nactivities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this will \\nrequire future work to define criteria. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe  main  potential  significant  harm  to  other  environmental  objectives  from  water  infrastructure \\nactivities are attributed to the alteration of hydromorphology due to dredging, maintenance activities \\nand  construction  of  new  infrastructures  and  waterways,  as  well  as  impact  on  biodiversity  and \\necosystems from such activities.  \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at \\nthe appropriate level.

In 2012, this was projected to increase to 104 TWh (or \\n4%) per year by 2020. The large consumption of energy is due to the need for permanent storage of data \\n(24 hour availability, back-up generators, etc.) and the need for cooling of the servers and other \\nequipment to maintain optimal operating temperatures401. \\n\\nConsidering this economic activity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on electricity, in a long-term scenario of decarbonized \\nbut limited energy from the grid, the sector mitigation potential has been identified in high standards of \\nenergy efficiency rather than in low carbon footprints. \\n\\nGiven the complexity of data centres \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which encompass hardware, software, cooling systems, \\nmonitoring  and back-up energy systems, only to name a few components \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the trade-offs that are \\npresent in the industry between energy efficiency and reliability and security, the TEG has opted for a \\ncomprehensive approach setting as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthreshold\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for significant contribution to mitigation a data centre \\ncompliance with the more advanced standard of energy efficiency available for this sector, the Best \\nPractice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (JRC) updated every \\nyear by the Commission to take account of technological advances402. \\n\\nData-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions \\n\\nDespite the almost negligible contribution to the economy, data driven solution for data collection, \\ntransmission and modelling of GHG emissions reductions-related information plays an important enabling \\nrole. Given the nature of the activity, no threshold are necessary. \\n\\nNext steps \\n\\nThe TEG recommends that the Commission undertakes work on the following activities. \\n\\n \\n\\n401 JRC, Best Environmental Management Practice in the Telecommunications and ICT Services Sector, 2016 available at \\nhttp://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/emas/documents/TelecomICT_BEMP_BackgroundReport.pdf \\n\\n402  The 2019 version is available at this link: https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/2019-best-practice-guidelines-eu-code-\\nconduct-data-centre-energy-efficiency \\n\\n \\n\\n360 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nTelecommunication networks \\n\\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) 403has developed two different electricity demand and energy \\nefficiency scenarios for data transmission networks (fixed+mobile) in 2021. The first scenario assumes a \\nmoderate rate of improvement in energy efficiency of 10% per year (which is close to conservative \\nestimates of historical improvements) and the other assumes a more rapid rate of improvement of 20% \\nper year. In the moderate efficiency-improvement scenario, the midpoint of the electricity demand range \\nin 2021 rises by over 70% to about 320 TWh. \\n\\nTo ensure significant contribution to climate change mitigation, the TEG has considered setting a \\nthreshold in terms of energy efficiency for each type of communication network, based on environmental \\nand energy efficiency standard as set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)404  \\nwhich fully take into account the complexity and diversity of telecommunication networks. The \\nrecommended threshold would be set at the top 10% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning that only the networks belonging to the \\ntop decile in their category for energy efficiency would qualify as Taxonomy-eligible. \\n\\nThis  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest-in- class\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach is different from the incremental or mitigation approach advocated by a few \\nstakeholders, who recommend defining significant contribution in terms of incremental improvement in \\nenergy efficiency compared to a previous baseline at every company. For example, a move from 4G to \\n5G \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which implies a 15% improvement in energy efficiency  - would qualify for the definition of significant \\ncontribution to mitigation. \\n\\nConsidering the potential use of the taxonomy, this approach would not be helpful for investors who need \\nto compare equity investments, and need to benchmark companies against each other, and not against a \\nprevious state. \\n\\nExample of activities in scope  based on this alternative approach: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Upgrading of telecommunication networks to new generation \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Energy efficiency and management in existing telecommunication networks \\n\\nBased on this alternative approach, threshold should for example be set in terms of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattaining at least \\n15% energy saving compared to the energy consumption measured before the eligible project was \\nimplemented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\nThe EU could explore the option to adjust the 10% threshold, in the context of the whole Taxonomy. \\n\\n \\n\\n403 IEA (2017), Digitalization & Energy, available at  \\nhttps://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/DigitalizationandEnergy3.pdf \\n \\n\\n404 See for examples Operational energy Efficiency for Users (OEU); Technical Global KPIs for Fixed Access Networks (ETSI) \\navailable at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/OEU/001_099/012/01.01.01_60/gs_OEU012v010101p.pdf  \\n\\nOr the ETSI ES 203 228 V1.2.1 (2017-04): Environmental Engineering (EE); Assessment of mobile network energy efficiency (ETSI) \\navailable at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/203200_203299/203228/01.02.01_60/es_203228v010201p.pdf \\n\\n \\n\\n361 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nSoftware \\n\\nThe energy efficiency of software and programming languages is an emerging area of research which is \\nstarting to grab the attention of academics405.

CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES \\n\\nPreamble \\n\\nIn the  EU,  buildings  are  effectively  the largest  energy  consuming  sector,  responsible for  around  40%  of \\nenergy consumption and 36% of carbon emissions.407 At the same time, embodied carbon emissions are \\nincreasing  and  receiving  growing  attention.  About  three-quarters  of  European  buildings  are  considered \\ninefficient, while only 0.4-1.2% (depending on the country) of the building stock is renovated each year to \\nimprove its efficiency408. Renovation rates must be increased in order to set the whole building stock on a \\nnet-zero emissions pathway, while embodied and operational carbon emissions of new buildings must be \\nsignificantly reduced in order to minimise their impact over their life cycle. At the same time, designing and \\nrenovating buildings to high energy performance standards is not sufficient to ensure low carbon emissions \\nduring operations, thus more needs to be done to address the \\xe2\\x80\\x98performance gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99409 of efficient buildings. \\nWithin this context, the TEG acknowledged the need for an ambitious approach and the crucial role that \\nthe taxonomy can play in directing financial flows towards the decarbonisation of the built environment. \\n\\nSubjects covered \\n\\nThe taxonomy distinguishes four \\xe2\\x80\\x98economic activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and defines consistent mitigation criteria that enable \\nassessing the eligibility of investments in construction and real estate on the basis of their potential impact \\non building energy performance and thus carbon emissions. The four activities are designed to be relevant \\nto most real estate market participants and facilitate investment flows to mitigation measures in the building \\nsector: \\n\\n1.  Construction of new buildings: this activity covers real estate development and enables accounting of: \\n\\na.  project  capital  expenditures  of  developers  and  construction  clients  as  eligible  \\xe2\\x80\\x98low-carbon \\n\\nactivities\\xe2\\x80\\x99; \\n\\nb. \\n\\nturnover of developers and contractors. \\n\\n2.  Building renovation: this activity covers comprehensive renovation and enables accounting of: \\n\\na.  project capital expenditures for renovation as eligible \\xe2\\x80\\x98transition activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  \\n\\ni.  When expenditures can be distinguished by type, at least 50% must be related to energy-\\nefficiency  measures  in  order  to  consider  the  renovation  expenditures  as  eligible  in  their \\nentirety. 410  \\n\\nii.  When  expenditures  cannot  be  distinguished  by  type,  50%  of  the  total  renovation \\n\\nexpenditures may be counted as the proxy representing energy-efficiency measures.  \\n\\n \\n\\n407 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-performance-of-buildings  \\n\\n408 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/eu-buildings-database  \\n\\n409 https://www.carbontrust.com/media/81361/ctg047-closing-the-gap-low-carbon-building-design.pdf  \\n\\n410 Certain types of financial instruments such as loans for acquisition and renovation of buildings may need to consider acquisition \\ncosts integrally with the eligible renovation costs if these costs cannot be practically separated in those types of financial \\ninstruments. \\n\\n \\n\\n367 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nb. turnover of contractors. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nIndividual  measures  and  professional  services:  this  activity  covers  technical  interventions  aimed  at \\nincreasing energy efficiency and professional services that are functional to energy improvements, and \\nenables accounting of: \\n\\na.  project capital expenditures of clients as eligible \\xe2\\x80\\x98transition activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99; \\n\\nb. \\n\\nturnover of installers and services providers. \\n\\n4.  Acquisition and ownership: this activity covers the purchase and management of buildings, and enables \\n\\naccounting of: \\n\\na.  project capital expenditures of the buyer/owner as eligible \\xe2\\x80\\x98transition activities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98low carbon \\n\\nactivities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 depending on building performance; \\n\\nb. \\n\\nturnover of real estate brokers and facility managers. \\n\\nSetting criteria and thresholds \\n\\nThe TEG faced several challenges to develop appropriate Mitigation criteria for the construction and real \\nestate sectors: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The  lack  of  consistent  and  comparable  data  across  countries  for  benchmarking  building  stock \\nperformance and setting suitable thresholds for the top performing buildings within the respective \\nnational stock.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The inherent difficulty of creating a level playing field across countries with different climates and \\ndegrees of market readiness. Compared to other economic  activities,  the  operation  of individual \\nbuildings has unique characteristics, which means the performance of different assets cannot easily \\nbe  compared.  Due  to  climatic  differences  across  regions,  buildings  in  different  locations  have \\ndifferent energy needs for heating, air conditioning and lighting, and therefore different potential to \\ncontribute to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the nature of the existing building stock varies \\nsignificantly from country to country, and even from region to region, due to differences in design, \\nconstruction techniques and building age. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The desire to find a compromise between rising ambition and building upon already existing \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nfinancing  instruments.  The  financing  of  buildings  and  building  energy  improvements  is  the  most \\ndeveloped segment of the green finance market, and  the ownership of buildings in portfolios is an \\nextensively practiced economic activity. As the Taxonomy is introduced to the market, it is important \\nto maintain the volume of existing investors and enable them to use the Taxonomy to evaluate their \\nportfolios. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The intention to direct finance towards new buildings designed to higher standards than mandatory \\ndesign  and  construction  requirements,  considering  the  varying  levels  of  ambition  and  rigor \\nregarding the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) across EU Member States. \\n411 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The  necessity  to  acknowledge  existing  high-performing  buildings  built  before  2021  through  a \\npractical  best-in-class  approach,  due  to  a  lack  of  transparency  on  national  performance \\nrequirement levels. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The urgent need to increase the number of energy renovations, especially in private households. \\n\\n411 According to Article 9 of the EPBD, by 31 December 2020 all new buildings must be NZEB. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n368 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nMeanwhile,  stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99  feedback  on  the  first  version  of  the  taxonomy  report  highlighted  the  following \\nissues: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The  need  to  foster  energy-efficient  operations  of  buildings  through  performance  monitoring  and \\n\\nreporting, while considering practicality and privacy requirements. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The need to ensure minimum safeguards across the building life cycle through DNSH criteria by \\nimplications  of \\n\\nadopting  EU  and \\ndemonstrating taxonomy eligibility across different building type and activities. \\n\\ninternational  standards  and  considering \\n\\nthe  practical \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The current inability of significant parts of the market to operate with carbon metrics, as well as the \\n\\nneed to progress towards the adoption of such metrics in conjunction with energy metrics. \\n\\nTaking into account these challenges and feedback, the TEG agreed on a specific strategy: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Setting criteria for new constructions to raise above mandatory design requirements and progress \\ntowards  net-zero  emissions  in  the  use  phase  by  2030,  and  work  to  introduce  a  requirement  on \\nincluding embodied carbon. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Setting  criteria  to  direct  finance  towards  a  large  volume  of  major  renovation  projects  as  well  as \\n\\ntowards individual measures aimed at improving energy and carbon performance. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Adopting  a  best-in-class  approach  to  ensure  that  the  acquisition  and  ownership  criteria  support \\nboth significant market uptake and sufficient environmental benefits. Encouraging buyers to acquire \\nefficient buildings  over less-efficient ones can also provide an opportunity to support substantial \\ncontribution  to  climate  mitigation  by  increasing  the  demand  for  such  buildings  and  by  enabling \\nbuyers to consume less energy during the use phase.  The TEG considers that the best-in-class \\napproach can be approximated by benchmarking the top performing 15% of the existing national \\nstock. This performance level is intended to decline following 2050 decarbonisation targets. The \\nperformance of the top performing 15%of the national stock needs to be transposed into absolute \\nenergy or carbon metrics, but the TEG considered that data is not yet adequately available.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Requiring improvements over time to ensure overall stock decarbonisation. The TEG is aware that \\nthere will be limited long-term impact in terms of emission reductions if the market simply trades \\nfinancial exposure in the top 15% of national stocks without improving the energy efficiency of such \\nbuildings  through  renovation.  In  fact,  there  may  be  a  risk  of  undermining  renovation  efforts  if \\nfinancing acquisition becomes  less  onerous  than financing energy  efficiency  measures.  For  this \\nreason,  the  TEG  recommends  introducing  a  requirement  to  renovate  assets  that  are  acquired \\nthough financial instruments that have long tenure periods. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Setting  additional  criteria  on  performance  monitoring  to  ensure  that  large  non-commercial \\n\\nproperties are efficiently operated and deliver real energy and carbon savings.  \\n\\nThese  principles  led  the  TEG  to  develop  the  following  criteria  to  identify  environmentally  sustainable \\nactivities in terms of Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation: \\n\\n1.  Construction of new buildings: to be eligible, the design and construction of new buildings needs \\nto  ensure  a  net  primary  energy  demand  that  is  at  least  20%  lower  than  the  level  mandated  by \\nnational regulations. This is assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building, \\ni.e. performance forecasted on the basis of modelling building physics under typical climatic and \\noccupancy conditions.  \\n\\n \\n\\n369 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nThis criterion is meant to be subject to reviews in the transitional decade 2020-2030 in order to take \\ninto  account  potential  tightening  of  NZEB  requirements  by  EU  Member  States,  with  the  aim  of \\nsetting the whole sector on convergence towards net-zero energy and carbon targets by 2030.  \\n\\n2.  Building renovations: renovations designed to meet the local national or regional requirements \\nfor \\xe2\\x80\\x98major renovation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as defined in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)412; this \\nwill stimulate the market and encourage building owners undertaking a \\xe2\\x80\\x98conventional\\xe2\\x80\\x99 renovation to \\ninclude  energy-efficiency  measures  established  by  EU  Member  States  in  national  and  regional \\nregulations implementing the EPBD.  \\nIn alternative, renovations are eligible if undertaken to ensure at least 30% savings in net primary \\nenergy  demand  in  comparison  to  the  baseline  energy  performance  of  the  building  before  the \\nrenovation, assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building.  \\nIndividual  measures  and  professional  services:  measures  and  services  aimed  at  reducing \\nenergy and/or carbon emissions in buildings. This is assessed through technical requirements for \\neach measure and service. \\n\\n3. \\n\\n4.  Acquisition and ownership: buildings built after 2021 are eligible if they meet the criteria for the \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Construction of new buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99, while buildings built before 2021 are eligible if their performance is \\ncomparable to the performance of the top 15% of the national stock, in terms of calculated  Primary \\nEnergy  Demand  during  the  use  phase.  An  additional  requirement  is  applied  only  to  large  non-\\nresidential buildings (built both before and after 2021) to ensure efficient operations through energy \\nmanagement.  \\n\\nWith regards to the criteria established for Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the other 5 environmental \\nobjectives, in the interest of practicality and ease of market application the TEG has opted to rely on EU \\npolicy  and  regulations  when  possible.  The  TEG  is  conscious  that  the  DNSH  criteria  to  climate  change \\nadaptation requires extensive clarification in terms of its implementation in practice. \\n\\nMarket coverage  \\n\\nExcept  for  buildings  used  for  the  extraction,  storage,  transportation  or  manufacture  of  fossil  fuels,  the \\ntaxonomy does not exclude any particular type of building, and therefore covers virtually the whole market \\nfor construction and real estate activities413. This does not mean that every activity will be eligible, only that \\nany participant in the market can use the taxonomy to assess the eligibility of his/her investments related \\nto buildings. \\n\\nThe Mitigation criteria will impact EU Member States differently as the share of the market eligible under \\nthe taxonomy will vary from location to location due to differences in the \\xe2\\x80\\x98levels of ambition\\xe2\\x80\\x99 established by \\nnational  regulations  (definition  of  NZEB  and  minimum  energy  performance  requirements  and \\nimplementation  of  the  EPBD)  for  new  and  existing  buildings  undergoing  and  renovations.  Buildings  in \\ncountries with a highly decarbonised electricity grid will have an inherent advantage in delivering net-zero \\ncarbon buildings. \\n\\n \\n\\n412 According to Article 7 of the EPBD buildings undergoing major renovation must meet the cost-optimal minimum energy \\nperformance requirements.    \\n\\n413 With the exemption of Article 4, paragraph 4 of the EPBD which allows EU Member States to exclude specific types of buildings \\nfrom the applying the minimum energy performance requirements.  \\n\\n \\n\\n370 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nFor renovations, differences in the minimum energy performance requirements set for \\xe2\\x80\\x98major renovations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nacross  EU  Member  States  imply  that  the  Mitigation  criteria  will  be  easier  to  meet  in  some  countries. \\nHowever,  it  should  be  considered  that  requirements  for  \\xe2\\x80\\x98major  renovations\\xe2\\x80\\x99  have  been  established  by \\nMember  States  on  the  basis  of  local  climatic  and  building  stock  conditions  as  well  as  cost-optimality \\ncalculations and will be to be updated in the future. \\n\\nOutside  the  EU,  the  share  of  the  market  that  could  be  eligible  will  also  vary  from  country  to  country. \\nCountries with ambitious building regulations that are accepted as taxonomy-equivalent will more easily be \\nable to make large shares of their market eligible. The principle of the top performing 15% of the national \\nstock provides a methodology to demonstrate eligibility of the non-EU best in class building stock.  \\n\\nFor renovations, the 30% energy savings threshold (alternative to the compliance with \\xe2\\x80\\x98major renovation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\nrequirements)  will  not  only  facilitate  immediate  functionality  of  the  taxonomy  outside  the  EU,  it  will  also \\nmake a significant part of renovation activities eligible, even in countries where national building regulations \\nmay not be ambitious enough. Moreover, the share of the market that could be eligible outside EU Member \\nStates will also depend on the local proliferation of taxonomy-eligible sustainability certification schemes.  \\n\\nImpact of proposals  \\n\\nUptake  if  the  taxonomy  among  market  participants  will  have  both  beneficial  and  adverse  effects  on  the \\nsector. By enabling owners and developers to access dedicated \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial instruments, the taxonomy \\nwill  stimulate  much  needed  investment  in  the  renovation  of  buildings  with  lower  levels  of  energy \\nperformance  as  the  well  as  construction  of  new  energy-efficient  buildings  and  the  efficient  operation  of \\nexisting buildings. Market participants who do not upgrade their practices in line with taxonomy criteria may \\nlose competitiveness and the ability to brand their economic activities and products as \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The TEG \\nacknowledges  the  risk  of  creating  stranded  assets  but  considers  that  by  creating  different  paths  to \\naccessing  finance,  sufficient  safeguards  have  been  included  in  the  criteria  to  adequately  manage  this \\npossibility.  \\n\\nIn terms of implementation costs, the taxonomy will affect market participants differently. Meeting eligibility \\ncriteria for new constructions, renovations and acquisitions may result in additional costs in comparison to \\nbusiness-as-usual  practices.  These  additional  costs  can  be  counterbalanced  over  time  through  the \\nexpected energy savings and the wider benefits (on health, comfort, lower volume of energy consumption \\nand reduced energy bills, etc) associated with high-performing buildings. Market participants may also incur \\nfurther costs due to the process required to demonstrate eligibility with taxonomy criteria, especially when \\nthe latter are based on several technical parameters. However, these parameters have been largely based \\non international standards and EU regulations to take into account usability issues, considering also the \\ndifferences between the residential and commercial sectors. \\n\\nOverall, considering the importance and urgency of improving the energy performance and decarbonising \\nthe building stock, the impact of implementation costs can be considered proportionate to the goals of the \\ntaxonomy, especially as successful taxonomy uptake will also have significant positive social and economic \\nimpacts. Requiring high standards for new buildings and renovating existing ones will reduce energy bills \\nand improve indoor air quality and thermal comfort, positively impacting occupants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health and available \\nincome. Requiring high standards will also stimulate the demand for sustainability professionals, service \\nproviders  and  skilled  construction  workers,  thus  creating  employment  and  upskilling  opportunities.  The \\neligibility of individual measures and professional services will also boost the market for energy efficiency, \\n\\n \\n\\n371 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nlow-carbon  technologies  and  related  services.  Eligibility  of  measures  such  as  the  installation  of  electric \\nvehicle charging stations will facilitate an integrated cross-sectoral approach with the transport sector. \\n\\nRecommendations for future developments \\n\\nThe TEG acknowledges the need to review and update the criteria identified in this report and encourages \\nthe Sustainable Finance Platform to agree on a timeline for this purpose. Consistency of criteria across the \\nfour activities should be maintained in future iterations of the taxonomy. \\n\\nThe  TEG  strongly  recommends  the  following  actions  in  order  to  develop  a  taxonomy  capable  of  fully \\ncovering the contribution that the built environment can bring to climate change mitigation: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The  Sustainable  Finance  Platform  should  establish  a  timeline  for  reviewing  the  20%  relative \\nimprovement  from  NZEB  requirements  (which  applies  to  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Construction  of  new  buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99),  in \\nconjunction with the expected updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States, and with the \\nclear objective of converging towards net-zero energy and net-zero carbon targets for new buildings \\nby 2030. Such targets are aligned with the strategies of the World Green Building Council414, the \\nGlobal Alliance for Buildings and Construction415 and other organisations416. Buildings built between \\n2021 and 2050 will represent up to 23% of the total stock in 2050 417. If the entire stock is meant to \\nbe net-zero carbon by 2050, it follows that those buildings built between 2021 and 2050 must be \\nnet-zero carbon in order for the overall target to be met.  The sooner new buildings are built with \\nnet-zero performance, the less difficult it will be to meet the 2050 target for the whole sector to be \\nnet-zero.  Since  the  TEG  recommends  working  towards  the  introduction  of  net-zero  carbon  only \\nafter 2030, this already constitutes a compromise between the urgent need to eliminate emissions \\nfrom  new  constructions  and  the  capacity  of  the  real  estate  sector  to  deliver  net-zero  carbon \\nbuildings.  \\n\\nConsidering the updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States (expected in 2023 and 2028), \\nthe timeline for the Sustainable Finance platform could be as follows: \\n\\no  2023: review of threshold, considering tightening of NZEB requirements; \\n\\no  2025: review of threshold, if necessary; \\n\\no  2028: review of threshold, considering tightening of NZEB requirements; \\n\\no  2030:  introduction  and  technical  definition  of  net-zero  energy  and  net-zero  carbon \\n\\nrequirements. \\n\\nWhere net-zero carbon is already mandated by regulation (as may be the case for some building \\ntypes  in some Member  States),  the  taxonomy  should  not  require better  performance, since net-\\nzero carbon can be considered sufficient (from the side of new constructions) to allow the entire \\nbuilding stock to be climate-neutral by 2050.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Although  the  reduction  of  carbon  embodied  in  buildings  has  been  often  neglected  in  favour  of \\nreducing  carbon  emissions  arising  during  operations,  awareness  of  their  importance  is  quickly \\n\\n414 https://www.worldgbc.org/thecommitment \\n\\n \\n\\n415 https://globalabc.org/uploads/media/default/0001/02/9ab4984b5d2e006ad533bca08257a43bdf974fa9.pdf  \\n\\n416 For example, C40 Cities (https://www.c40.org/) and Architecture 2030 (https://architecture2030.org/2030_challenges/) \\n\\n417 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/docs/pages/com_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0.pdf  \\n\\n \\n\\n372 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\ngrowing  among  built  environment  professionals,  while  methods  and  tools  for  embodied  carbon \\nassessment based on LCA are becoming more widespread. Notably, a large share of emissions \\nembodied in buildings takes place during resource extraction and product manufacturing, before \\nbuildings  are  even occupied, which means that all new constructions  begin their lifecycle with a \\nsignificant amount of embodied carbon.  \\n\\nThe  Sustainable Finance  Platform should gather  and analyse existing  data in  order  to establish \\nreliable thresholds  for  carbon  emission  embodied  in  new  constructions,  which  will  be  integrated \\ninto the taxonomy criteria for the activity \\xe2\\x80\\x98Construction of new buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as additional threshold to \\nbe  met.  These  thresholds  should  be  based  on  a  wide  and  consistent  set  of  data,  suitable  for \\nbenchmarking best practice across different building uses and typologies (i.e. houses, flats, offices, \\netc.), thus the Sustainable Finance Platform should encourage and support the generation of such \\ndata.  The  Sustainable  Finance  Platform  should  progress  this  work  with  the  aim  of  introducing \\nthresholds for embodied carbon by 2025.  \\nIn parallel,  the  methodology  adopted  to  assess  embodied emissions  should be  defined  in  detail \\nwith reference to widely accepted LCA and CEN/TC350 standards, with particular attention towards \\nadequately recognising the beneficial impact of carbon sequestration in timber products sourced \\nfrom sustainably managed forests. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  By  the  end  of  2024,  the  Sustainable  Finance  Platform  should  establish  absolute  thresholds  for \\nenergy and carbon emissions to represent the performance of the top 15% of national stocks and \\nprovide a clear decarbonisation pathway as threshold for assessing the acquisition and ownership \\nof assets built before 2021. By then, the performance of the top 15% of each national stock will \\nhave been converted into absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions. Until 31 December \\n2025, the top 15% of the national stock represents the performance level required to be eligible, \\nFrom that date onward, and every five years afterwards, the performance level should be lowered \\nto  reflect  a  pathway  reaching  net-zero  operational  carbon  in  2050.  Such  pathway  could  look  as \\nfollows:  \\n\\no  Until  2025:  X  kgCO2eq/m2y,  corresponding  to  the  performance  of  the  top  15%  of  the \\n\\nnational stock \\n\\no  2026-2030: (5/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\no  2031-2035: (4/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\no  2036-2040: (3/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\no  2041-2045: (2/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\no  2046-2050: (1/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\no  From 2051: net-zero kgCO2eq/m2y \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Sustainable Finance Platform should consider how to address long-term eligibility, i.e. assets \\ncovered by financial instruments with a tenure period of ten years or more. These assets could be \\nrequired to be renovated in order to maintain eligibility. For example, there could be a requirement \\nfor renovations to occur within 15 years from the acquisition date.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Sustainable Finance Platform should provide guidance on the practical implementation of the \\nDNSH criteria to climate change adaptation, especially for the activity of building renovation taking \\ninto account the need to avoid disproportionate administrative and financial burden. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to address \\ncarbon  emissions  arising  from  unregulated  energy  use  (i.e.  plug-in  electric  loads)  in  buildings, \\n\\n373 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nconsidering different building typologies. Emissions due to unregulated energy use are not currently \\ncovered by the criteria established in this report, but these emissions can represent a significant \\nshare of the operational impact of buildings, especially from specific non-residential typologies. To \\nshorten the process and avoid the duplication of efforts, these thresholds could be developed on \\nthe  basis  of  the  decarbonisation  trajectories  identified  in  the  research  project  Carbon  Risk  Real \\nEstate Monitor (CRREM), funded by Horizon 2020. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The  Sustainable  Finance  Platform  should    periodically  review  and  update  the  list  of  eligible \\n\\nindividual measures and professional activities.  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to address \\nScope 1 emissions of construction companies, i.e. emission that are associated with the operation \\nof such firms and the associated construction works. \\n\\nThe Platform should ensure future alignment of the existing Individual Measures with the low-carbon \\ntechnology list within the Manufacturing sector. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n374 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n8.1   Construction of new buildings \\n\\nSector classification and activity \\n\\nMacro-Sector \\n\\nF \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Construction \\n\\nNACE Level \\n\\n2 \\n\\nCode \\n\\nF41, F43 \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nConstruction of new buildings.

The organisation responsible for the \\nscheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting \\nevidence that a specific level of certification/regulation can be considered \\nequivalent (or superior) to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold for the \\nrelevant climatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform will \\nassess the evidence and approve or reject the application. \\n\\nThe metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED), defining the energy performance of \\na building: the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy \\nuse during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. \\xe2\\x80\\x98module B6\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as \\ndefined in EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to the national methodologies \\nfor asset design assessment, or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000, \\nexpressed as kWh/m2 per year. \\nThe threshold is based on \\xe2\\x80\\x98nearly zero-energy building\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (NZEB) requirements, \\nwhich are defined in national regulation implementing the EPBD and are \\nmandatory for all new buildings across EU Member States from 2021. To be \\neligible, the net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least \\n20% lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant NZEB \\nrequirements.418 This reduction can be met through a direct decrease of the \\n\\n \\n\\n418 The PED is either directly expressed by NZEB requirements or is derived by applying those requirements and calculating the \\nresulting PED. When NZEB requirements specify a PED, the percentage improvement should be applied to this figure. \\n\\n \\n\\n375 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nprimary energy demand via a more efficient design or by offsetting with on-site \\nand off-site renewable generation, or a combination of both strategies. Off-site \\nenergy generation must be limited to district heating and cooling systems and \\nlocal renewable energy sources. 419  \\n\\nThe methodology used for the measurement of floor area should be stated \\nreferring to the categories defined in the International Property Measurement \\nStandards.420 \\n\\nThe establishment of a relative threshold in the form of a percentage improvement on NZEB \\nrequirements is justified by the fact that from 2021 new constructions will be mandated by \\nnational/regional building regulations to comply with NZEB requirements. This implies that the \\ntaxonomy must require better levels of performance than NZEB, or all new constructions would be \\nautomatically eligible, which would fail to direct finance towards more sustainable solutions and run \\nthe risk of diverting finance from the renovation of existing buildings. Since NZEB requirements \\ncorrespond to different levels of performance across EU Member States , the use of a percentage \\nimprovement, rather than absolute figures, allows a degree of proportionality to be applied: in \\nMember States where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively low PED, the energy reduction \\nnecessary to achieve the 20% improvement is smaller than in Member States where NZEB \\nrequirements result in a comparatively high primary energy demand. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the \\nconstruction of new buildings is determined by: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience to \\n\\nfuture temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Landfill and/or incineration of construction and demolition waste that could be otherwise \\n\\nrecycled/reused. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Presence of hazardous contaminants in the soil of the building site. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nInappropriate building location: impacts on ecosystems if built on greenfield and especially if \\nin a conservation area or high biodiversity value area. \\nIndirect damage to forest ecosystems due to the use of timber products originating form \\nforests that are not sustainably managed. \\n \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n(2) Adaptation  \\n\\n(3) Water \\n\\nRefer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\nAll relevant water appliances (shower solutions, mixer showers, shower outlets, \\ntaps, WC suites, WC bowls and flushing cisterns, urinal bowls and flushing \\n\\n \\n\\n419 As defined in national methodologies developed by EU Member States to implement the EPBD \\n\\n420 International Property Measurement Standards (IPMS): https://ipmsc.org/ \\n\\n \\n\\n376 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(4) Circular \\nEconomy \\n\\n(5) Pollution \\n\\ncisterns, bathtubs) must be in the top 2 classes for water consumption of the EU \\nWater Label.421  \\n\\nAt least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition \\nwaste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the \\nEU waste list422) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use \\nor sent for recycling or other material recovery, including backfilling operations \\nthat use waste to substitute other materials.423  \\n\\n5.a - It is ensured that building components and materials do not contain \\nasbestos nor substances of very high concern as identified on the basis of the \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAuthorisation List\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the REACH Regulation.424  \\n\\n5.b \\xe2\\x80\\x93 If the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site \\n(brownfield site), the site must be subject to an investigation for potential \\ncontaminants, for example using standard BS 10175.425 \\n\\n5.c \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Non-road mobile machinery used on the construction site should comply \\nwith the requirements of the NRMM Directive. \\n\\n(6) Ecosystems \\n\\n6.a - The new construction must not be built on protected natural areas, such as \\nland designated as Natura 2000, UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity \\nAreas (KBAs), or equivalent outside the EU as defined by UNESCO and / or the \\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) under the following \\ncategories:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserve \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category Ib: Wilderness Area \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category II: National Park \\n\\nBuildings that are associated supporting infrastructure to the protected \\nnatural area, such as visitor centres, museums or technical facilities are \\nexempted from this criterion.   \\n\\n6.b - The new construction must not be built on arable or greenfield land of \\nrecognised high biodiversity value and land that serves as habitat of endangered \\n\\n \\n\\n421 (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/) Outside the EU, relevant water appliances will need to meet the flow rates identified by the \\nEU Water Label as threshold for the top 2 classes of water consumption.

While specific \\ndata on embodied carbon and thus carbon emissions from the full lifecycle is still \\nlimited and needs to be further generated, the acquisition of buildings designed to \\nminimise energy use and carbon emissions during the use phase can already \\nmake an important contribution by directing users towards high-performing \\nproperties and by sending signals to markets about the need to lift the overall \\nenergy performance of the whole stock. \\n\\nFor large non-residential buildings (i.e. buildings with an effective rated output for \\nheating systems or systems for combined space heating and ventilation of over \\n290 kW, or buildings with floor area437 over 1000 m2), an additional requirement is \\nintroduced to ensure that these buildings are operated efficiently, and that actual \\nenergy and carbon savings are delivered each year. \\n\\nCondition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climate \\nmitigation objective, the acquisition and ownership of buildings for the purpose of \\nextraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels are not eligible. \\n\\nUse of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, established \\nschemes such as \\xe2\\x80\\x98green building\\xe2\\x80\\x99 certifications or building regulations may be \\nused as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by the \\nSustainable Finance Platform. The organisation responsible for the scheme will \\nbe able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a \\nspecific level of certification/regulation can be considered equivalent (or superior) \\nto the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold established for the relevant \\nclimatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the \\nevidence and approve or reject the application. \\n\\nMetric and \\nthreshold \\n\\nThe metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED): the annual primary energy demand \\nassociated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building \\nlife-cycle (i.e. \\xe2\\x80\\x98module B6\\xe2\\x80\\x99 according to EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to \\n\\n437 Measured according to the IPSM 1 definition, see https://ipmsc.org/ \\n\\n \\n\\n387 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nthe national methodologies for asset design assessment, or as defined in the set \\nof standards ISO 52000, expressed as kWh/m2 per year. \\n \\n\\nCase A \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Acquisition of buildings built before 31 December 2020 \\n\\n \\n\\nThe calculated performance of the building must be within the top 15% of the local \\nexisting stock in terms of operational Primary Energy Demand, expressed as \\nkWh/m2y. \\n\\nAlignment with this criterion can be demonstrated by providing adequate evidence \\ncomparing the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the local \\nstock built before 31 December 2020. Such evidence should be based on a \\nrepresentative sample of the building stock in the respective area where the \\nbuilding is located, distinguishing at the very least between residential and non-\\nresidential buildings. The area can be defined as a city, a region or a country.  \\n\\nCertification schemes such as EPCs may be used as evidence of eligibility when \\nadequate data is available to demonstrate that a specific level (e.g. EPC A) clearly \\nfalls within the top 15% of the respective local stock. \\n\\nThe TEG recognises that more work needs to be done to collect and analyse data \\nin order to define absolute thresholds corresponding to the performance of the top \\n15% of each local stock, such as data showing the distribution of EPCs across the \\nstock and the thresholds used to define EPC ratings. \\n\\nLarge non-residential buildings must meet an additional requirement: efficient \\nbuilding operations must be ensured through dedicated energy management.438 \\n\\n \\n\\nCase B \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Acquisition of buildings built after 31 December 2020 \\nThe building must meet the criteria established for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Construction of new \\nbuildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that are relevant at the time of the acquisition.  \\n\\nLarge non-residential buildings must meet an additional requirement: efficient \\nbuilding operations must be ensured through dedicated energy management. \\n\\nRationale \\n\\nThe acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the \\nlifecycle instead of lower-performing ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change \\nmitigation objectives by: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\ncreating demand for such buildings; this in turn will stimulate owners to build and renovate \\nbuildings to a higher level of performance than they would have done otherwise. \\nsending a clear signal to the market that the acquisition of such buildings against an ever more \\nstringent legislative background and changing client preferences can help reduce future \\npotential risk and value depreciation. \\n\\nFor buildings built after 2020, the same criteria established for the activity \\xe2\\x80\\x98Construction of new \\nbuildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are applied. Buildings built before 2021 are assessed on the basis of a best in class \\n\\n \\n\\n438 This can be demonstrated, for example, through the presence of an Energy Performance Contract or an energy management \\nprogramme supported by a building management system. \\n\\n \\n\\n388 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\napproach in each local stock. Rather than attempting to establish absolute thresholds with an \\nincomplete set of data, for the time being the TEG opted for a threshold based on a percentage of the \\nstock, which ensures a level-playing field across different Member States. For now, the corresponding \\n15% was deemed an appropriate level for the best in class performance, finding a compromise \\nbetween the need to establish high standards of performance while recognising the need to maintain \\nand create opportunity in the existing market. \\n\\nDo no significant harm assessment \\n\\nThe main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the \\nacquisition of buildings is determined by: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience of to \\n\\nfuture temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Presence of hazardous contaminants in the soil of the building site. \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nInappropriate building location: impacts on ecosystems if built on greenfield and especially if in \\na conservation area or high biodiversity value area. \\n \\n\\n(2) Adaptation \\n\\nRefer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.  \\n\\n(3) Water \\n\\n(4) Circular Economy \\n\\n(5) Pollution \\n\\n(6) Ecosystems \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIf the property is located on a potentially contaminated site (brownfield site), \\nthe site must be subject to an investigation for potential contaminants, for \\nexample using standard BS 10175.439 \\n\\n6.a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The building must not be built on protected natural areas, such as land \\ndesignated as Natura 2000, UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity \\nAreas (KBAs), or equivalent outside the EU as defined by UNESCO and / or \\nthe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) under the \\nfollowing categories:  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserve \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category Ib: Wilderness Area \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Category II: National Park \\n\\n439 BS 10175:2011+A2:2017 - Investigation of potentially contaminated sites.

Supporting \\nadaptation of other \\neconomic activities \\n\\nThe economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other \\neconomic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation. \\nActivities enabling adaptation include, but are not limited to, activities \\nthat: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Promote a technology, product, practice, governance \\n\\nprocess or innovative uses of existing technologies, products \\nor practices (including those related to natural infrastructure); \\nor, \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  Remove information, financial, technological and capacity \\n\\nbarriers to adaptation by others. \\n\\nB1.1  The economic activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical \\n\\nclimate risks beyond the boundaries of the activity itself. The activity \\nwill need to demonstrate how it supports adaptation of others \\nthrough: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  an assessment of the risks resulting from both current \\n\\nweather variability and future climate change, including \\nuncertainty, that the economic activity will contribute to \\naddress based on robust climate data; \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\x9f  an assessment of the effectiveness of the contribution of the \\neconomic activity to reducing those risks, taking into account \\nthe scale of exposure and the vulnerability to them. \\n\\n \\nIn the case of infrastructure linked to an activity enabling adaptation, \\nthat infrastructure must also meet the screening criteria A1, A2 and \\nA3.  \\n\\nB1.2 \\n\\n \\n\\n392 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAdditional information \\n\\nSome extra information is provided throughout this report for the economic activities in the taxonomy, and \\nactivities which should be included in future subject to full DNSH assessment.

This is explicitly defined in Article 29(7)b which requires \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6management \\nsystems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or \\nstrengthened over the long term.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate for \\nthe operation of the Taxonomy and/or investment, rather than relying on national level requirements.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n410 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n(5) Pollution \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or \\n\\ntechniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the \\nDirective 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exception \\nof occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. \\nAdapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of \\nnutrients to waters. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active \\n\\ningredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam \\nConvention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone \\nLayer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended \\nClassification of Pesticides by Hazard; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Prevent pollution of water and soil in the forest concerned and undertake \\n\\nclean up measures when it does happen. \\n\\n(6) Ecosystems \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Take measures to ensure sustained or improved long term conservation \\n\\nstatus at the landscape level458 \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\n\\nIn designated conservation areas, actions should be demonstrated to be in \\nline with the conservation objectives for those areas.   \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of \\nhigh conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock \\narea (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration \\nof such habitats in line with national legislation \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisions \\n\\nfor maintaining biodiversity459  \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease the \\n\\namount and quality of ecosystem services provided. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, in \\n\\ncompliance with national laws \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the \\n\\nlocal requirements and limitations; \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of \\n\\ntrees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, \\nnatural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the \\narea concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species \\nunder local conditions, current and projected climate change. \\n\\n \\n\\n458 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal to preserve conservation status for different species is \\nat a scale above the single forest stand. \\n\\n459 This criterion should be considered in combination with criterion 3 of the mitigation criteria to disclose through a forest \\nmanagement plan (or equivalent). \\n\\n \\n\\n411 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.

FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES  \\n\\nBackground \\n\\nAccording to the World Economic Forum Report (2020), more common extreme weather events could \\nmake insurance unaffordable or simply unavailable for individuals and businesses.  Globally, the \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98catastrophe protection gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99 - what should be insured but is not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reached US$280 billion (EUR\\xe2\\x82\\xac252 \\nbillion) in 2018596.  The TEG is concerned to address the widening protection gap by classifying \\nselected non-life insurance lines of business (LOBs) as substantially contributing to \\xe2\\x80\\x98adaptation by\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  \\nThe eligible economic activity substantially contributes to \\xe2\\x80\\x98adaptation by\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when it meets Principle B1.1 \\nwhereby: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of the \\nactivity itself. This includes activities that: \\n\\na) Promote a new technology, product, practice or governance process or innovative uses of existing \\npractices (including those related to natural infrastructure); or, \\n\\nb) Remove information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation by others.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nNon-life insurance eligible for the Taxonomy includes selected LOBs and insurance products and \\nservices that provide cover for climate-related hazards to activities and/or assets that are Taxonomy \\naligned.   \\n\\nAs the number and range of sub-sectors eligible for the Taxonomy evolves arising from development \\nof substantial contribution to the remaining four environmental objectives, additional activities will \\nbecome eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance products.  Furthermore, the TEG believes \\nthat economic activities that may not be screened for substantial contribution to any of the six \\nenvironmental objectives, such as environmentally neutral activities (schools, hospitals, public \\nadministration services, etc.), which may nonetheless be impacted by climate change should be \\nconsidered as potentially eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance. TEG recommends further \\nconsideration of DNSH criteria for non-life insurance activities to enhance the coverage of activities \\nand improve usability of the criteria. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n596 The Global Risks Report 2020, World Economic Forum Insight Report 15th Edition, In partnership with Marsh & McLennan \\nand Zurich Insurance Group. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-  573 - \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n8.1   Non-life insurance  \\n\\nSector classification and activity  \\n\\nMacro-Sector  \\n\\nFinancial services and insurance \\n\\nNACE Level  \\n\\n4 \\n\\nCode  \\n\\nNACE code: 65.12 \\n\\nCPA codes: 65.12.49 \\n\\nDescription  \\n\\nNon-life insurance for activities and/or assets that are covered by the EU \\nTaxonomy.
